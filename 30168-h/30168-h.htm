<h2 class="gap3">PREFACE</h2>


<p>The history of Giggleswick School has just two
difficulties about it which need to be unravelled.
The date of the foundation of the School or of the
Chantry of the Rood and the origin of the Seal
alone are of interest to the antiquary and I have failed
to discover either. The remainder is the story of a
school, which has always had a reputation in the
educational world and at the same time has left only
the most meagre records of itself. The gentry of the
neighbourhood were its scholars, but few have made
their fame in the world without. Headmasters and
Ushers have passed their lives here, but few were
ambitious. Giggleswick was their haven of old age.
Customs grew up, the same customs died and only
seldom is it possible to conjecture their character.</p>

<p>A nation without a history is considered to have
had the most blessed existence and the same is
true of a school. Giggleswick has but once been
the prey of the brigand and then it was fortunate
enough to have a friend at court. It lost its
original endowment and its private character. It
gained a larger revenue and a Royal Charter. The
placidity of its life was undisturbed by financial
deficits. Its income expanded steadily. The close
corporation of Governors were never ambitious to
display their wealth, they never excited the greed of
the statesman; even Cromwell's army passed through
the district unmentioned by the Minute-Book.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_vi" id="Page_vi">[Pg vi]</a></span></p>

<p>It did not grow, it made no history, but continued
on the even tenour of its path. Some years it was
effective as a school of instruction, some years it was
not, but never did it meet with the inquisitorial
landlord, never but once did it suffer from the Crown.
With the nineteenth century came its first crisis for
three hundred years and it passed through unhurt. A
new school with the old endowments, a better education
with a wider horizon, a new power with which to meet
the coming needs were all engrafted on the old
foundation. If romance involves moments of startling
excitement, Giggleswick has no romance. But if
romance lies in an unrecorded, unenvied continuity, in
the affection of pupils that age after age causes men
to send their sons and their sons' sons to the same
school, then the history of Giggleswick is shot through
with romance. No school can continue for more than
a generation, if this supreme test of its hold upon the
hearts of men should fail. The school that nurtured
the father must do its duty by the son and the golden
link of affection is forged afresh.</p>

<p>It would have been impossible to complete the
task of writing the history of the School, if I had not
received invaluable help from many sources. Two
men in particular must accept my deepest gratitude&mdash;Mr.
A. F. Leach and Mr. Thomas Brayshaw. Mr.
Leach is the foremost authority in England on English
Grammar Schools and he has never stinted his help.
Mr. Brayshaw probably knows more than any other
man of the history of the School during the last
eighty years and he has supplied me generously
with pamphlets and information. In addition he
has been most assiduous in helping me to choose and
decipher documents belonging to the School, which
the Governors of the School were kind enough to<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_vii" id="Page_vii">[Pg vii]</a></span>
allow me to use. The Rev. G. Style, the Rev. J. R.
Wynne Edwards and many others have helped me
materially with Chapters X and XI, while Mr. J.
Greaves, of Christ's College, Cambridge, sent me his
own copy of Volume I of the Christ's Admission Book
and an advance proof copy of Volume II.</p>

<p>The photographs are taken from originals in the
possession of Mr. A. Horner, of Settle, Mr. P. Spencer
Smith and Mr. E. D. Clark. Mr. Spencer Smith in
particular has gone to endless trouble in procuring
photographs of every kind for the special purpose of
this book.</p>

<p>These names by no means include all those who
have helped me with advice on many occasions. I
thank them all and in particular I would thank the
present Headmaster, Mr. R. N. Douglas, who has put
every convenience in my way and without whose
co-operation the book could never have been written.</p>

<h2>The Foundation.</h2>


<p><span class="dropcap">G</span>IGGLESWICK School for over four
hundred years has lived a life apart,
unconscious of the world outside: but
its life has not therefore been a placid one.
Real dangers have continually assailed it, real
crises have been faced. Most schools have been
founded with a preliminary grant of an endowment,
with which to afford a proper maintenance to
Master and Scholars. But Giggleswick was
not one of these. Its actual origin is obscure
but this at least is sure, it existed before it
was endowed. It was the private enterprise of
one man, James Carr, who in 1518 "nuper
decessit."</p>

<p>Nineteen years before, the same James Carr
was a capellanus in charge of the Rood Chantry,
which he himself had founded. The date of its
foundation has not reached us, but the fact of
its existence, and consequently the probable<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_14" id="Page_14">[Pg 14]</a></span>
existence of the Grammar School, is certain
in 1499.</p>

<p>In that year two-and-a-half acres of arable
land in Settle and a meadow called Howbeck
ynge were let to one William Hulle by the
indenture of the cantarist. The cantarist or
chantry priest was James Carr. Six years later,
Hugh Wren, William Preston and James Carr,
capellani, were made joint owners of "unum
messuagium et unam bovatam terr&aelig; et prati."</p>

<p>These two possessions conclusively prove
the existence of the Rood Chantry and the
presence of James Carr during the last year of
the fifteenth century, and from that year
Giggleswick School may date its birth. The name
Carr is variously spelt. Skarr, Car, Carre, Karr,
Ker, all appear, but no importance is to be
attached thereto. Spelling as part of the
equipment of an educated man is one of the
less notable inventions of the nineteenth century.
As a family the Carrs come from Stackhouse,
a village quite close to Giggleswick, but their
recorded history begins with this generation.
The father of James is nameless, but his eldest
brother Stephen was living at Stackhouse in
the year 1483, when he leased a plot of land
from the Prior and Convent of Finchale. It
was therefore not unnatural that James should
found a chantry in the neighbourhood of his
family home.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_15" id="Page_15">[Pg 15]</a></span></p>

<p>The purpose of a chantry was the offering
up of prayers for the souls either of the founder
or of such as he might direct. We do not
know the original cause of James Carr's Chantry
or for whose soul he prayed. But in 1509 he
received a legacy from his brother Thomas, who
was vicar of Sancton. The gift consisted of
"unam calicem argenteam" and with it there
was a request "ut oretur pro anima mea et
parentum meorum diebus Dominicis." Henceforth
this was his duty. But a weekly service
of prayer on Sundays would be a poor occupation
for a man, even though he had clearly another
Mass to say as well. And he endeavoured to
dispel the monotony of his chantry by teaching.
He followed a common practice of chantry priests,
but he had some additional qualifications for
the work. He belonged to a local family of
some importance, he had a certain income of his
own, and he was prepared to take boarders as
well as to teach the boys in the village.</p>

<p>The unique character of his enterprise
declares itself very soon. He was so successful
a teacher that he could no longer find it possible
to carry on his work in his own house or possibly
"like a pedant that keeps a school in a church,"
he required a building larger and more convenient.
In other words he was prepared to take a risk
and to invest his own capital in buildings. It
is the only instance that has been recorded of<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_16" id="Page_16">[Pg 16]</a></span>
what Mr. A. F. Leach calls a Private Adventure
School. It was not endowed from an outside
source before 1553, but until the year 1518
was the private property of James Carr. He
endowed the Rood Chantry with lands producing
six pounds one shilling a year, and the successive
chantry priests carried on the teaching that he
had begun.</p>

<p>On November 12, 1507, a lease had been
entered into between "the Right Reverende
ffader in Gode, Thomas, Prior of Duresme and
Convent of the same on the one partie and
James Karr, preste, on the other partie" by
which the said James was given a seventy-nine
year lease of "half one acre of lande with the
appertenance, laitlye in the haldyng of Richarde
lemyng, lyeng neir the church garth of
Gyllyswyke in Crawen within the countie of
york." He and his successors contracted to
pay a full or rack-rent of xij<i>d.</i> of lawful English
money every year and an additional vj<i>s.</i> viij<i>d.</i>
as often as it might be desired to extend the
lease. It was also provided that "whensoever
the same James Karr shall change his naturall
lyfe that then it shalbe lawful, as ofte tymes
as it shalbe nedful, to the vicar of ye churche
afforsaid for the tyme beyng and kyrkmasters
of the same, heires, executors, and assignes to
the said James Karr, jontlie, to elect one person
beyng within holye orders, to be scole master<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_17" id="Page_17">[Pg 17]</a></span>
of the gramer scole afforsaid." Such Schoolmaster
had not only to be within "holye orders"
but also to receive a license to teach from the
Prior of Durham. Not till the nineteenth
century was teaching a grammar or classical
school regarded as a profession independent of
the Church.</p>

<p>The half acre that he thus obtained was
ordered to be enclosed and James Carr agrees
that he will keep or cause to be kept there
"one gramer scole" building it "at hys awne
propyr charges and costes."</p>

<p>The <i>Gentleman's Magazine</i> in 1786 contains
a letter from a correspondent describing the
school that Carr built. It was low, small and
irregular and consisted of two stages, whereof
at that period the upper one was used for
writing, etc., that is to say for elementary
education, probably reading, writing and
arithmetic; the lower stage on the other hand was
used for advanced teaching. This would include
the elaborate classical curriculum common to almost
every school and to which we shall return later.
On the North side there was a small projecting
building, which before 1786 had contained a
tolerable collection of books but at that time
they had been dispersed. The date of the
completion of the building is fixed by an
inscription on a stone which was placed almost
above one of the doors and is still preserved<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_18" id="Page_18">[Pg 18]</a></span>
in the modern Big School.</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">

</div></div>

<p>The inscription is an ingenious but not
altogether happy example of Carr's ability as a
writer of Latin Hexameters.</p>

<p>Above this stone slab was an ornamented
niche, which at one time contained an image
but of which no knowledge can be obtained.
It may have held a statue of the Virgin and
Child and be the origin of the school seal, as
a writer in the <i>Giggleswick Chronicle</i>, March
1907, suggests, but the chantry was not dedicated
to the Virgin, it was the "Chaunterie of the
Rode" and as such we should expect to find a
crucifix with the Virgin standing by it.</p>

<span class="caption">FIRST SCHOOL, 1512.</span>
</div>

<p>There is only one other record of the School
during the next thirty years but it is a very
important one, for it shows that the School was
not restricted to the village but encouraged
boarders from distant villages and towns. About
the year 1516 William Malhame writes to his
brother John:<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_19" id="Page_19">[Pg 19]</a></span></p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>"Brother, I will Sir W. Martyndale to be Parish
Priest at Marton, and to have like wages that Sir

shall be allowed ye ageane. From London ye second
day of Aprill.</p>

<p class="signature">"By your Brother Wm. Malhame.</p>
<p>"To his Brother John Malhame."</p>
</div>

<p>In September 1518, the Craven with Ripon
Act Book describes James Carr as one who
"nuper decessit" and his will was proved. No
trace of it has been found but we know from
the Chantry Commissioners' Report in 1546
that he had endowed the Chantry School with a
rental of &pound;vi xij<i>d.</i></p>

<p>The Commission had been appointed to
ascertain the chantry property which might be
vested in the King. There were two excellent
reasons for the change. Many avaricious men had
already on various pretexts "expulsed" the
priests or incumbents and taken the emoluments
for themselves. Such private spoliation could
not be allowed. And in the second place
Henry VIII had involved himself in "great
and inestimable charges" in the maintenance
of his wars in France and Scotland. He needed
money and he saw an easy way to getting it.
The Chantry Commissioners made their report,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_20" id="Page_20">[Pg 20]</a></span>
but before many chantries were taken by the
King, he died. At once the Chantries Act,
which was only for Henry's life, is dissolved
naturally.</p>

<p>Edward VI, "monstrificus puellus," was
a precocious child of nine years old when he
succeeded to the throne. The first "Injunctions"
issued in his name gave distinct promise
for educational bodies, as they comprised an
order, compelling all chantry priests to teach
the children reading and writing. Thus at one
stroke of the pen he converted a body of men,
who had insufficient work to do, into National
Schoolmasters. Such a measure would tend to
improve the quality of the chantry priests, who
would no longer run "unto London, unto St.
Poules" seeking for a chantry of souls, seeing
that the toil of a Schoolmaster would be their
lot.</p>

<p>But within a year a fresh Chantries Act
was passed and a new Commission appointed by
the Protector and his Council. The Act
contained a prefatory statement which maintained
that "a great part of superstition and errors
in Christian religion has been brought into the
minds and estimations of men" and this
"doctrine and vain opinion by nothing is more
maintained and upholden than by the abuse of
trentals, chantries, and other provisions made
for the continuance of the said blindness and<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_21" id="Page_21">[Pg 21]</a></span>
ignorance." They therefore determined to
dissolve the chantries and at the same time
continue Grammar Schools, where they existed.
The results belied the early promise. The clauses
relating to the endowment of Grammar Schools
have gained Edward VI a widespread fame as
a founder of most of the schools in England.
But that fame has been wholly fictitious.</p>

<p>Henry VIII had wrought great damage to
elementary education, although he had professed
"I love not learning so ill, that I will impaire
the revenues of anie one house by a penie,
whereby it may be upholden." But it has been
calculated that in 1546 there was probably one
school for every eight thousand people, whereas
three hundred years later, the proportion was
thrice as small. Yet Edward VI did not found
one school in Yorkshire, and many, which had
previously existed, he deprived of all revenue.
So diminished were the means of education in
1562 that Thomas Williams, on his election as
Speaker of the House of Commons, took occasion
to call Queen Elizabeth's notice to the great
dearth of schools "that at least one hundred
were wanting, which before this time had been."
In other words in a period of less than thirty
years the number had decreased by a third.
And this was in spite of a six years' reign of
Edward VI., the supposed progenitor of
schools.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_22" id="Page_22">[Pg 22]</a></span></p>

<p>In the report of the Commissioners of 1548
Giggleswick is recorded as having three
chantries. There was the Chantry of Our
Lady, the incumbent of which, Richard
Somerskayle, is described as "lx yeres of age,
somewhat learned" and enjoying the annual
rent of &pound;4. The Tempest Chantry with
Thomas Thomson as incumbent 70 yeres old
and "unlearned." The Chantry of the Rode,
"Richard Carr, Incombent, 32 yeres of age,
well learned and teacheth a gramer schole
there, lycensed to preach, hath none other
lyving than the proffitts of the said chauntrie."
The net value of the chantry was &pound;5 15<i>s.</i></p>

<p>Richard Carr was a nephew of the founder
and from the description of his two fellow
chaplains he was evidently superior to the
ordinary chantry priest. They were "unlearned,"
"somewhat learned," he was "well learned" and
"lycensed to preach." For all that the chantry
lands were taken from him, but the School was
not dissolved: he was maintained as a
Schoolmaster by a stipend of the annual value
of &pound;5 6<i>s.</i> 8<i>d.</i> charged on the crown revenues
of York "for the good educacyon of the
abbondaunt yought in those rewde parties."</p>

<p>The population of Giggleswick, which as a
parish included Settle, Rathmell, Langcliffe and
Stainforth, was roughly 2,400 and at the
beginning of the nineteenth century was<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_23" id="Page_23">[Pg 23]</a></span>
unaltered. Such a population was too "abbondaunt"
for one man to teach, particularly if he took
boarders, and it is not surprising to find in
the report of 1548 the following paragraph:</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>"A some of money geven for the meyntenance of
scholemaster there. The said John Malhome and one
Thomas Husteler, disseased, dyd gyve ... the
some of &pound;24 13<i>s.</i> 4<i>d.</i> towards the meyntenance of a
Scholemaister there for certen yeres, whereupon one
Thomas Iveson, preist, was procured to be Scholemaister
there, which hath kept a Scole theis three yeres last
past and hath receyved every yere for his stypend
after the rate of &pound;4, which is in the holle, &pound;12."</p>

<p class="center">"And so remayneth &pound;12 13<i>s.</i> 4<i>d.</i>"</p></div>

<p>John Malhome was probably the brother of
William, who in 1516 had sent James Smith to
be a boarder at the School, and, as he was a
resident in the neighbourhood and was a
"preist," perhaps a chantry priest at Giggleswick,
his interest in the School is not unnatural.</p>

<p>Thomas Husteler had an even more
adequate reason for leaving money to pay the
stipend of a Schoolmaster, for he had been
priest of the Chantry of the Rood, and had
been wont to "pray for the sowle of the founder
(James Carr) and all Cristen sowles and to
synge Mass every Friday of the name of Jhesu
and of the Saterday of our Lady." He had
also to be "sufficientlie sene in playnsonge and
gramer and to helpe dyvyne service in the
church."<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_24" id="Page_24">[Pg 24]</a></span></p>

<p>Thus in addition to his chantry duties he
had to perform the double office of Grammer
and Song Schoolmaster, and the work proving
too heavy for him he left money to provide
the maintenance of a second Master. Thomas
Iveson received this money and probably acted
either as an Usher or as Song Schoolmaster.
Many schools in England employed a Master to
teach music but during the sixteenth century a
change was gradually taking place. Many Song
Schools ceased to exist and everywhere the song
master became of less importance. In 1520
Horman had written "No man can be a
grammarian without a knowledge of music;"
Roger Ascham, although he quoted with approval
Galen's maxim "Much music marreth man's
manners" considered that its study within certain
limits was useful; and in 1561 Mulcaster declared
that all elementary schools should teach Reading,
Writing, Drawing and Music. Music then was
no longer a part of the general curriculum, but
was chiefly restricted to the Cathedral Choir
Schools, where the young chorister had a career
opened up for him either in the church or as a
member of a troupe of boy-actors. It is
therefore of some interest to find that in 1548
the Master at Giggleswick had a knowledge of
plainsong as well as grammar.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_25" id="Page_25">[Pg 25]</a></span></p>

<h3 class="smcap"><a name="Chapter_II" id="Chapter_II"></a>Chapter II.</h3>

<h2>1553-1592.</h2>


<p><span class="dropcap">G</span>IGGLESWICK Church had been given to
the Priory of Finchale by Henry de
Puteaco about 1200, and Finchale was
a cell of the Prior and Convent of Durham.
So from that date till the Dissolution of the
Monasteries the Priors continued to appoint the
Vicar. When however in 1548 the church
became vacant the rights of the convent were
vested in Edward VI and he appointed to the
office one of his chaplains John Nowell.</p>

<p>Nothing is known of him. He may have
been the brother of Alexander Nowell, a
prominent divine both under Mary and her
successor, and for a time Head Master of
Westminster, Principal of Brasenose College,
Oxford, and for over forty years Dean of S.
Paul's. This Alexander was a leader of
education; he wrote a Catechism that became
a school text-book and he assisted to re-found<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_26" id="Page_26">[Pg 26]</a></span>
a free school at Middleton. It is not a wholly
unsound conjecture, if we suppose that the John
Nowell, who assisted to re-found Giggleswick
was, if not a brother, at least a member of the
same family as Alexander whose home was at
Whalley.</p>

<p>We know at least that he was Vicar of
Giggleswick till 1558. During his first five
years Richard Carr, assisted for a time by
Thomas Iveson, was continuing to teach in the
small and irregular building of James, his
uncle; and as a stipend he was receiving
annually &pound;5 6<i>s.</i> 8<i>d.</i></p>

<p>This money ceased to be paid after 1553,
in which year on May 26 Edward VI "of
happy memory" was pleased to grant a Charter
to the School and to endow it with property.
This he did at the humble petition of John
Nowell, vicar, Henry Tennant, gentleman, and
other inhabitants of the town and parish of
Giggleswick in Craven.</p>

<p>Quite forgetful of the School's previous
existence for over half a century, he ordains
that "from henceforth there may and shall be
one Grammar School ... which shall be
called the Free Grammar School of King Edward
the Sixth of Giggleswick, and the same School
for ever to continue of one Schoolmaster or
Headmaster and of one Under Master or Usher."</p>

<p>This limitation of the teaching staff to one<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_27" id="Page_27">[Pg 27]</a></span>
Headmaster and one Usher led to serious qualms
of conscience among the Governors in the last
decade of the eighteenth century, when the
revenues and numbers of the School had been
very greatly increased. They then added to
the number of the staff and discovered that they
had contravened the Charter of Edward VI, and
this difficulty was one of those that led to the
application in 1795 for new Statutes.</p>

<p>It was to be a "free" school, not in
any restricted, unusual sense of the word, not
free from ecclesiastical interference, that did not
come till the nineteenth century, not free
from temporal interference, that has never come,
but free from fees, giving gratuitous teaching.
The Charter was an English document translated
into Latin. Hence it is not a question whether
the word "libera" can ever be understood in
the sense of gratuitous. The Latin word is
used as being not the exact, but the nearest
equivalent of the English. The Free Grammar
School undoubtedly meant exemption from fees
and all other meanings are heresies of the
nineteenth century, fostered only too willingly
by those guardians of Grammar Schools, who
were not eager to fill their class-rooms with
boys from the locality free of charge and so to
exclude the sons of "strangers" who were
ready to pay for the privilege. The Charter
then named eight men of the more discreet and<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_28" id="Page_28">[Pg 28]</a></span>
honest inhabitants of the Town and Parish of
Giggleswick to be Governors of the said School.
They were:</p>

<p style="margin-left:40%">
<span class="smcap">John Nowell</span>, Vicar.<br />
<span class="smcap">William Catterall</span>, of Newhall.<br />
<span class="smcap">Henry Tennant</span>, Gentleman.<br />
<span class="smcap">Thomas Procter</span>, of Cletehop.<br />
<span class="smcap">Hugh Newhouse</span>, of Giggleswick.<br />
<span class="smcap">William Browne</span>, of Settle.<br />
<span class="smcap">Roger Armisted</span>, of Knight Stayneforde.<br />
<span class="smcap">William Bank</span> of Fesar.<br />
</p>

<p>The Vicar, for the time being, must always
be a Governor and with one other he had the
sole power of summoning the rest to a meeting.
Collectively they could appoint the Headmaster
and Usher, make elections to their own body,
when any other than the Vicar died or left the
neighbourhood, and make statutes and ordinances
for the government of the School with the advice
of the Bishop of the Diocese. If the Vicar
should infringe the said statutes they could for
the time being elect another of the inhabitants
into his place. They were a corporate body
and could have a common seal.</p>

<p>An endowment was provided for them out
of the confiscated property of S. Andrewes
College, Acaster, in the parishe of Styllingflete
in the Countie and Citie of York. Acaster had
been founded about 1470 and consisted of three
distinct schools, Grammar, Song and Writing,
the last intended to "teach all such things as<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_29" id="Page_29">[Pg 29]</a></span>
belonged to Scrivener Craft." The property
included land in North Cave, South and North
Kelthorpe and Brampton. A further grant
was made of land in Edderwick, Rise and
Aldburgh which had formed part of the
endowment of the Chantry of the Blessed
Virgin Mary in the parish of Rise and Aldburgh.</p>

<p>These lands were situated in the East
Riding and their whole value amounted annually
to &pound;23 3<i>s.</i> of which they had to pay an annual
rent to the King of sixty-three shillings. The
Trustees were further allowed to purchase or
receive gifts of land, etc., for the maintenance
of the School, provided that such additional
endowment did not exceed the clear yearly value
of &pound;30.</p>

<p>The grant does not sound over-generous,
but it is necessary to multiply money to twenty
times its value, in order to obtain a clear
estimate of it in this century. On such a
computation it would amount to &pound;400 a year
after paying the King's rent, and in addition,
it would be possible to acquire by gifts or
legacies another &pound;600, making a possible income
of &pound;1,000. The Common Seal that the Governors
used is of an origin altogether obscure. It
represents presumably the Virgin and Child
while below is the figure of a man praying.
Round the rim are the words:</p>

<p class="center">Sigillum Prebendarii de Bulidon</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_30" id="Page_30">[Pg 30]</a></span></p>

<p>It may be that Bulidon has in course of time
been corrupted and that some modernized form
of it exists, with records of a collegiate church.
It is quite clearly the seal of a canon or
prebendary, but as yet no one has discovered
his church or his name. Perhaps Nowell was
a prebendary and this was his seal, which he
transferred to the Governors for their corporate
use.</p>

<p>The Governors were empowered to make
"de tempore in tempus" fit and wholesome Statutes
and Ordinances in writing concerning the
Governors ... how they shall behave
and bear themselves in their office ...
and for what causes they may be removed; and
touching the manner and form of choosing and
nominating of the chief master and undermaster,
and touching the ordering, government and
direction of the chief master and undermaster
and of the scholars of the said School, which
said Statutes were to be inviolately observed
from time to time for ever.</p>

<p>No record remains of Statutes made in
accordance with this royal permission until
thirty-nine years later. Custom no doubt played a
great part in the government of the School and
it continued steadily on the lines first laid down
by James Carr. But towards the close of the
century the country was awakening from the
materialism which had girt it round. The<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_31" id="Page_31">[Pg 31]</a></span>
danger of invasion had passed away. The seeds
of religious fervour were bearing fruit. A
militant, assertive Puritanism was vigorously
putting forward its feelers throughout the
length and breadth of England, nor was education
the last to be affected. Throughout history it
has been the aim of the enthusiast to make
education conform to a single standard.
Sometimes it has been the value of the
disputation, sometimes of the sense of Original
Sin, sometimes of the classics. At the close
of the sixteenth century Original Sin had
become an important factor in the theories
of the expert, and its presence is marked in the
Giggleswick Ancient Statutes of 1592.</p>

<p>On Sunday the 2nd of July, 1592, between
the hours of three and five in the afternoon,
Christopher Foster, public notary and one of
the Proctors of the Consistory Court at York,
appeared personally before John, Archbishop of
York, in the great chamber of the Palace at
Bishopthorp. He there presented his letters
mandatory, sealed with the common seal, for
Christopher Shute, Clerk, Bachelor of Divinity,
Vicar of the Parish Church of Giggleswick,
Henry Tenant, Antony Watson, Richard Chewe,
gentlemen, Thos. Banckes, and Roger Carre,
yeomen.</p>

<p>He had brought with him "Letters Patent
wrote on vellum of the late King Edward the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_32" id="Page_32">[Pg 32]</a></span>
Sixth of happy memory concerning the foundacion
of the said ffree Grammar School and sealed
with the great seal of England." These he
shewed to the Archbishop together with certain
wholesome Statutes and Ordinances, which they
had determined upon. The Archbishop consented
to deliberate concerning the matter and consulted
with counsel learned in the law in that behalf.
Later on the 3rd day of October after mature
deliberation, he was pleased to transmit the said
Statutes to be registered in the Chancellor's
Court at York by the hands of John Benet,
Doctor of Laws and Vicar General. The
Statutes were accordingly confirmed and remained
valid for over two hundred years.</p>

<p>The Governors bound themselves to choose
from time to time men of true and sound
religion, fearing God and of honest conversation.
In spite of these somewhat grandiose qualifications
it was found necessary to make a second
regulation by which each Governor on his
election should protest and swear before the
Vicar of Giggleswick and the rest of the
Governors to be true and faithful towards the
School and its emoluments and profits and not
to purloin or take away any of the commodities
of the same, whereby it might be impoverished
or impaired in any respect.</p>

<p>The third paragraph provided for the election
of a new governor in case of a vacancy occurring<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_33" id="Page_33">[Pg 33]</a></span>
through removal from the district or "if any
of them be convicted of any notorious cryme:"
in his place was to be chosen a godly, discreet,
and sober person. Once, at least, every half-year
they were to visit the School and examine
the labours of the Master and Usher and also
the proceedings of the Scholars in good literature.
If any fault was to be found in the observation
of the Statutes on the part of the Master or
Usher or Scholars, the Governors had the right,
of admonishing the offenders and if after
admonition twice given amendment was not
made, they could remove them. On the other
hand the control of the Master over the Scholars
was not absolute, but was shared with the
Governors.</p>

<p>Finally they were to see to the revenues
of the School, and to pay stipends to the Master
and Usher, "neither shall they make any wilful
waste of the profits but be content with a
moderate allowance, when they are occupied
about the business of the said School."</p>


<p class="center gap3"><span class="smcap">The Master.</span></p>

<p>The Master was to be a man fearing
God, of true religion and godly conversation,
not given to dicing, carding, or any other
unlawful games. These Statutes were the
outcome of custom and it is not unreasonable
to suppose that while such general expressions as<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_34" id="Page_34">[Pg 34]</a></span>
true religion and godly conversation represented
the national feeling of the time, particular
prohibitions of dicing and carding had reference
to special weaknesses of the contemporary
Master. Thus at Dronfield in 1579 the Master
was particularly enjoined not to curse or revile
his scholars.</p>

<p>The three following clauses refer to the
instruction of the Scholars in godly Authors for
Christian Religion, and other meet and honest
Authors for more Knowledge of the Liberal
Sciences. He shall once every week catechize
his Scholars in the Knowledge of the Christian
Religion and other godly Duties to the end
their Obedience in Life may answer to their
proceedings in godly Literature.</p>

<p>He shall not teach them any unsavoury
or Popish doctrines or infect their young wits
with heresies. He shall not use in the School
any language to his Scholars which be of riper
years and proceedings but only the Latin,
Greek or Hebrew, nor shall he willingly permit
the use of the English Tongue to them which
are or shall be able to speak Latin. These are
regulations typical of the century and we shall
return to them more fully on a later page.</p>

<p>Giggleswick was a free school but it was
clearly not intended to be only a local school,
for the Master was to teach indifferently, that is
to say, impartially, the Poor as well as the Rich,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_35" id="Page_35">[Pg 35]</a></span>
and the Parishioner as well as the Stranger, and,
as they shall profit in learning, so he shall
prefer them, without respect of persons.</p>

<p>Vacations were to consist of two weeks at
Easter, three weeks at Christmas, and three
weeks to be by the said Master appointed when
he thinketh it most convenient for his Scholars
to be exercised in writing under a Scrivener for
their better exercise in that faculty; provided
that he could also upon any convenient occasion
grant an intermission from study, in any
afternoon, whensoever he seeth the same
expedient or necessary. He himself could not
be absent at any other time above six days, in any
one quarter without the special license of the
Governors.</p>

<p>For these pains and labours he was to
receive as recompense the yearly stipend of
twenty marks or &pound;13 6<i>s.</i> 8<i>d.</i> of lawful English
money, to be paid twice in the year in equal
portions at the feast of S. Peter Advincula and
at the feast of the Purification of Our Lady.
Lastly he was not to "begyne to teache or dismiss
the schoole without convenient prayers and
thankesgyveing in that behalfe publiquely to be
used."</p>


<p class="center gap3"><span class="smcap">The Usher.</span></p>

<p>The Usher likewise was to be a man "of
sounde religion and sober lyfe and able to train<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_36" id="Page_36">[Pg 36]</a></span>
up the youth in godliness and vertue:" obedient
to the Master and directed by him in his
teaching. Every year he was to prefer one
whole form or "seedge" to the Master's erudition
and if they failed, he would stand subject to
censure from the Master and Governors.</p>

<p>He was not to absent himself more than
four days in any quarter without license from
the Master and Governors and in the absence
of the Master was to supply his office. For
this he received just half the former's yearly
stipend, or &pound;6 13<i>s.</i> 4<i>d.</i>, to be paid in equal
portions twice in the year.</p>

<p>Together they had to begin work every
morning at 6-30, "if they shall see it expedient,"
and continue till 11-0 a.m. Then they had a
rest till 1-0 o'clock, after which they worked
till 5-0 p.m.; except during the winter season
when the times of beginning of the school and
dismissing of the same shall be left to the
discretion of the Master. They could with the
assent of the Archbishop of York and upon
admonition twice given be expelled from their
office or upon one admonition or two be fined or
censured according to the quality of their offence.</p>


<p class="center gap3"><span class="smcap">The Scholars.</span></p>

<p>The Governors alone, with the consent of
the Master, could expulse a Scholar for
rebelliously and obstinately withstanding the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_37" id="Page_37">[Pg 37]</a></span>
Master or Usher; but if any scholar, upon
proof first had, should be found altogether
negligent or incapable of learning, at the
discretion of the Master he could be returned
to his friends to be brought up in some other
honest trade and exercise of life.</p>

<p>They could not be absent without leave:
and if they did not obey the two Prepositors,
by the Master to be appointed for order and
quietness in the School they were to be subject
to the severe censure of the Master or Usher.
Lastly if they behaved themselves irreverently
at home or abroad towards their parents, friends,
or any others whatsoever, or complained of
correction moderately given them by the Master
or Usher, they were to be severely corrected
for the same.</p>

<p>The stipends of the Master and Usher were
not wholly ungenerous. Mulcaster, who had
founded Merchant Taylors' School and had two
hundred and fifty boys under his charge received
only &pound;10: at Rotherham the Grammar Master
received &pound;10 15<i>s.</i> 4<i>d.</i>; this was in 1483
but it was extremely good pay for the period.
Even Eton College which had a revenue of
over &pound;1,000 at the time of Edward VI's Chantry
Commissioners' Report was only paying its
Schoolmaster &pound;10. It is true that these Schools
had also a varying number of boys paying small
fees, but such additional income was not part<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_38" id="Page_38">[Pg 38]</a></span>
of the foundation. For Giggleswick with a
revenue of &pound;20 (exclusive of the King's rent
of &pound;3 3<i>s.</i>) and a further possible revenue of
&pound;30, to pay the whole of its &pound;20 as a stipend
to the Headmaster and Usher was a distinctly
liberal proceeding.</p>

<p>The discretionary power of the Master with
regard to the discipline of the School appears
to be greatly limited. He is bidden appoint two
prepositors, he is even advised as to some
particular occasions on which he shall correct
the scholars. But these regulations probably
only codify existing custom, and in practice, no
doubt, the Master would find himself almost
entirely free from control. Nevertheless such
regulations were not without their danger.</p>

<h3><a name="Chapter_III" id="Chapter_III"></a><span class="smcap">Chapter III.</span></h3>

<h2>Schools and their Teaching in the
Sixteenth and Seventeenth Centuries.</h2>


<p><span class="dropcap">F</span>ROM the fifteenth century at least the
local Grammar School was the normal
place of education for all classes but
the highest. In 1410 an action for trespass
was brought by two masters of Gloucester
Grammar School against a third master, who
had set up an unlicensed school in the town
and "whereas they used to take forty pence or
two shillings a quarter, they now only took
twelve pence," and therefore they claimed
damages. In the course of the argument the
Chief Justice declared that "if a man retains
a Master in his house to teach his children, he
damages the common Master of the town,
but yet he will have no action."</p>

<p>Instances such as this tend to shew that
it was the exception for boys to be taught either
at home by a private tutor or under a man
other than the Public Schoolmaster.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_40" id="Page_40">[Pg 40]</a></span></p>

<p>In England, Schools, from the first, that is
from their introduction together with Christianity,
had been exclusively ecclesiastical institutions
and were under ecclesiastical authority and
regulation. In 1215 the Fourth Lateran Council
had said that there should be a Schoolmaster
in every Cathedral, and that he should be
licensed by the Bishop. In 1290 at Canterbury
the Master had even the power of excommunicating
his Scholars. At a later date many chantry
priests by the founder's direction, a few
voluntarily undertook the task of teaching. In
1547 they were compelled to do so by a law,
which after a year was rendered nugatory by the
confiscation of Chantries. In 1558 Elizabeth
ordained that every Schoolmaster and Teacher
should take the oath, not only of Supremacy but
also of Allegiance. Even after the Reformation
they had still to get the Bishop's license and this
continued till the reign of Victoria, save for a
brief period during the Commonwealth, when
County Committees and Major-Generals took the
responsibility.</p>

<p>The curriculum in Schools at the beginning
of the sixteenth century consisted of what was
called the Trivium, Grammar, Dialectic, and
Rhetoric. The Quadrivium or Music, Arithmetic,
Geometry and Astronomy, was relegated to the
Universities and only pursued by very few.
In 1535 Henry VIII wished "laten,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_41" id="Page_41">[Pg 41]</a></span>
greken, and hebrewe to be by my people
applied and larned." Latin was not in those
days a mere method of training the youthful
mind, it was much more a practically useful
piece of knowledge. It was a standard of
communication and a storehouse of phrases.
It was taught in the most approved fashion, as
a language to be spoken to fit them, as Brinsley
says, "if they shall go beyond the seas, as
gentlemen who go to travel. Factors for merchants
and the like."</p>

<p>Almost every boy learned his Latin out of
the same book. Lily's Grammar was ordered to
supplant all others in 1540. The smallest local
Grammar Schools had much the same text-books
and probably as good scholars as
Eton or Winchester or Westminster. The
Master and Scholars must not talk any language
other than Latin, Greek or Hebrew according
to the Giggleswick Statutes, and at Eton and
Westminster the same rule applied; at those
Schools any boy discovered talking English
was punished with the name of Custos, a title
which involved various unpleasant duties.</p>

<p>Greek and Hebrew are both in the
Giggleswick curriculum. Hallam says that
in 1500 not more than three or four persons
could be mentioned, who had any tincture of
Greek. Colet, in his re-foundation Statutes of
S. Paul's School ordained that future Head<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_42" id="Page_42">[Pg 42]</a></span>masters
"must be learned in good and clean
Latin Literature" and also "in Greek, if such
may be gotten." But towards the close of the
century Greek had become well-established.
Durham introduced it in 1593, the Giggleswick
Statutes imply its use in 1592, and Camden,
Headmaster of Westminster, in 1597 brought
out a Greek Grammar, which became as
universal as Lily's Latin Grammar.</p>

<p>Of Hebrew there are few records, and none
at Giggleswick, it was probably allotted very
little time, and certainly at the Universities, it
was for long at a very low ebb.</p>

<p>With regard to English very little was
done. Erasmus was responsible for a slightly
wider outlook and he encouraged History in Latin
books and in a less degree Geography as a
method of illustration. Mulcaster who published
his book "Positions" in 1561 deplored the fact
that education still began with Latin, although
religion was no longer "restrained to Latin."
The Giggleswick Statutes set it forth that the
Master shall instruct his scholars&mdash;for more
knowledge of the Liberal Sciences and catechize
them every week in the knowledge of Christian
Religion.</p>

<p>If the Liberal Sciences were the appointed
task, and, if in addition, he must speak Latin
or Greek or Hebrew, the boy of 1592, long as
his school hours undoubtedly were, would be well<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_43" id="Page_43">[Pg 43]</a></span>
occupied. We have no evidence on the point,
but we can conjecture from other sources the
nature of the knowledge of Christian Religion
that they were expected to have.</p>

<p>The Primer was the layman's service-book,
and consisted largely of matter taken from the
Hor&aelig; or Hours of the Blessed Virgin Mary:</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">This litel child his litel book lerninge,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">As he sat in the scole at his prymer.<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>In 1545 Henry VIII had issued a new
edition in consequence of the Reformation and
he now set it forth as the only edition to be
used, and emphasized the importance of learning
in the vernacular, the Pater Noster&mdash;Ave Maria&mdash;Creed&mdash;and
Ten Commandments.</p>

<p>The Primer was a book of devotion, the
Catechism was rather a summary of doctrines.
Alexander Nowell, Dean of S. Paul's and
possibly a brother of the Giggleswick John
Nowell had published a Catechism in 1570,
which supplanted all others even those "sett
fourth by the Kinges majesties' authoritie for
all scolemaisters to teache," and it was Nowell's
Catechism that the School Statutes expected to
be used.</p>

<p>The Bible was not definitely a school subject
till 1604, and although it was in earlier use in
some places of education, there is no mention
of it at Giggleswick. There is however one<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_44" id="Page_44">[Pg 44]</a></span>
more religious aspect of school life that was
very general and is mentioned in these particular
Statutes. The Master shall not begin to teache
or dismiss the School without convenient Prayers
and Thanksgivings. The Prayers would probably
consist of the Ten Commandments, the Lord's
Prayer, and the Creed.</p>

<p>Of Grace there is no mention, but in
1547 Edward VI had issued injunctions that
"All Graces to be said at dinner and supper
shall be always said in the English Tongue."</p>

<p>Every year the Master was allowed to
appoint three weeks for the boys to be exercised
in writing under a Scrivener. There were in
Yorkshire peripatetic Scriveners, who used to
wander from school to school and teach them
for a few weeks in the year, after which the
writing in the school would be neglected. At
Durham School the writing had to be encouraged
by a system of prizes, by which the best writer
in the class would receive every Saturday all the
pens and paper of his fellows in the form. St.
Bees Grammar School in 1583 tried a similar
system from another point of view, they paid
the Usher 4<i>d.</i> yearly for every boy "that he
shall teach to write, so long as he takes pains
with them." But paper was a very great
expense; for by the year 1600 there were only
two paper factories in England and the price
for small folio size was nearly 4<i>d.</i> a quire.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_45" id="Page_45">[Pg 45]</a></span>
Writing indeed was only beginning to be common
in the schools, it had long been looked upon
merely as a fine art and for ordinary purposes
children had been taught by means of sand
spread over a board. Henceforward steps are taken
all over England to ensure its teaching; at
first the expert, the Scrivener, goes round from
school to school, but later the ability of the
Ushers improves and no longer need they fear
the competition of a rival, they begin to teach
the boys themselves and writing becomes a part
of the ordinary curriculum.</p>

<p>It will be recognized that there is a central
motive of religion pervading the teaching and
conduct of schools towards the close of the
sixteenth century, and in the seventeenth, as there
always had been. "We have filled our children's
bones with sin" says Hezekiah Woodward,
"and it is our engagement to do all we can to
root out that which we have been a means to
root in so fast." A more serious spirit was
abroad. The young man was to abstain from
singing or humming a tune in company "especially
if he has an unmusical or rough voice." Schoolmasters
were to abstain from "dicing and
carding," scholars from misdemeanour and
irreverent behaviour towards others.</p>

<p>Latin, Greek and Hebrew, became the
"holy languages" because they were so closely
allied with the Sacred Scriptures. Throughout<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_46" id="Page_46">[Pg 46]</a></span>
education a deeper sense of the value of religious
teaching, a deeper conviction that sin was
detestable, a greater respect for outward sobriety
fastened upon the minds of those who were
responsible for education, and the children whom
they trained grew up to be the fathers and
mothers of the intense enthusiasts, who enforced
religious freedom by the execution of their
King.</p>

<h2>Christopher Shute and Robert Dockray,
1599-1642.</h2>


<p><span class="dropcap">C</span>HRISTOPHER Shute was appointed Vicar
of Giggleswick in 1576. He had been a
Sizar of Pembroke Hall, Cambridge, in
1561 and graduated B.A. in 1564, M.A. 1568, and
B.D. in 1580. He was a writer on religious
subjects and published "A Compendious Forme
and Summe of Christian Doctrine, meete for
well-disposed Families" and among other
writings "A verie Godlie and necessary
Sermon preached before the young Countess
of Cumberland in the North, the 24th of
November, 1577."</p>

<p>After he had been appointed Vicar of
Giggleswick by Queen Elizabeth, he took a
very sincere interest in the fortunes of the
School, and at his suggestion and Henry
Tennant's the Statutes of 1592 were set forth.
In 1599 he began a Minute-Book to record "all
constitutions, orders, eleccions, decrees, statutes,
ordinances, graunts, accounts, reckenninges and
rents for the free Grammar Schoole of Giggleswick<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_48" id="Page_48">[Pg 48]</a></span>

These being Governors:</p>

</p>

<p>He did not give the book definitely until 1604
"ad usum legum, decretorum, electionum,
compitorum," and there are no entries in it
between the years 1599 and 1603.</p>

<p>The period during which Christopher Shute
was a Governor was marked by great prosperity
in the fortunes of the School. During the first
twenty years of the new century, many rich gifts
were received. The first of these that is recorded
is in 1603 when John Catterall, Esquire, of
Newhall, leased to his fellow Governors a
meadow in Rathmell for "their only use and
behoof" for twenty-one years; the Governors
leased it in their turn for an annual rent of
33<i>s.</i> 4<i>d.</i> and eventually, though the exact date
is not mentioned, John Catterall bought it back<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_49" id="Page_49">[Pg 49]</a></span>
for a fixed sum of &pound;13 6<i>s.</i> 8<i>d.</i> and an annual
rent of 33<i>s.</i> 4<i>d.</i> as the former lessee had not
paid his rent.</p>

<p>In 1603 also, William Clapham, Vicar of
"Runtoun in the county of Northfolke by his
last will and testament bearing daite the fyft
day of July, 1603," bequeathed to the schoole
the patronage, free gift and advowson of the
Churches and Rectories of Fulmodestone,
Croxton and Rolleston in the county of
Norfolk, "And the yearlie pension or porcionn
paiable out of them of iiij<i>li.</i> viij<i>s.</i> viij<i>d.</i> I will
that iiij<i>li.</i> thereof be yearlie for ever imploied
towards the maytaynance or fynding of a poore
scholer of the said schoole of Gigleswick, being
of the said parish of Gigleswicke or Clapham,
to be kept to Learning in somme Colledge in
Cambridge: Provided alwaies and my will is
that he shall be one of the Claphams or
Claphamsons, if there shall be anie of those
names meete and fitte theirfore, and to have
the said yearly allowance of iiij<i>li.</i> for the space
of seaven yeares, if he continue and abide in
Cambridge so long." ... "And the other
viij<i>s.</i> viij<i>d.</i> I will that the one half theirof
shall be bestowed yearlie toward a potacionn
amongst the poore schollers of the same schoole,
for the tyme being one Saincte Gregories daie,
and the other half distributed amongst the poore
of the said parish of Gigleswick yearlie on<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_50" id="Page_50">[Pg 50]</a></span>
Easter daie for ever, to be ordered, governed
and distributed from tyme to tyme by the
Feoffees, overseers, governors, and rulers of the
said Schoole for the tyme being, whereof one to
be a Clapham if their be anie of the name in
the same parish meet for that office."</p>

<p>Potations, thus provided for by William
Clapham, were common to many schools and
were gifts of food and beer by the Master to
the Scholars, who in their turn were expected
to bring gifts of money and thus enable the
Master of a Free School to get an addition to
his pay. At Nottingham Dame Mellers in 1512
did "straitlye enjoyne that the Scholemaister, and
Usshers, nor any of them, have, make, nor use
any potacions, cock-fighte or drinking with his
or their wiffe at wiffes' hoost or hoostices, but
only twice in the yeare nor take any other
giftes or avayles, whereby the Schollers or their
Frendes should be charged, but at the playsure
of the frends of the Scholers, save the wages
to be payde by the sayde Gardyans." On the
other hand in the Hartlebury School Statutes,
1565, it is written "the said Schoolmaster shall
... take the profitts of all such Cocke-fights
and potations as be comonlie used in
Scholes." At Cambridge "they have a potation
of Figgs, Reasons and Almons, Bonnes and
Beer at the charge of the sayed Determiners."</p>

<p>Such was the custom and William Clapham<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_51" id="Page_51">[Pg 51]</a></span>
evidently intended by his gift of 4<i>s.</i> 4<i>d.</i> to
relieve the Master from the expense and allow
the gifts to be pure profit. Unfortunately no
record has been traced of any gifts though there
are entries in the Minute-Books of payment of
expenses on March 12, 1626, "charges this day
vi<i>s.</i> vi<i>d.</i>," which probably refer to the expenditure
upon the scholars. Such mention is quite
exceptional up till the close of the seventeenth
century. The usual accounts are much
briefer, giving no details of expenditure but
mentioning the balance only <i>e.g.</i> "their remaineth
in the hands of John Banks fifty-eight pounds
eighteen shillings sixpence."</p>

<p>In time Clapham's bequest increased in
value and was reckoned in the Exhibition
Account. Certainly from 1767 the Exhibition
Account gave something towards the cost of
the Potation. In 1767 it was &pound;1 7<i>s.</i> 0<i>d.</i>, in
1770, 11<i>s.</i> 3<i>d.</i> In 1782 it becomes a fixed sum
of &pound;1 10<i>s.</i> 4<i>d.</i> and the Governors make up the
rest from another account. In one year 1769
it was regarded as a joint expenditure by the
Governors and Masters. During the last twenty
years of the eighteenth century the expenditure
averaged &pound;2 10<i>s.</i> 0<i>d.</i> In 1814 it was
&pound;8 1<i>s.</i> 2<i>d.</i>, thus proving independently that
the numbers of the School must have increased
considerably. In 1839 figs and bread are
mentioned as having been bought and the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_52" id="Page_52">[Pg 52]</a></span>
Charity Commissioners' Report of 1825 says
that beer had ceased to be provided. The figs
and bread continued to be distributed till 1861,
after which the practice ceased.</p>

<p>The Scholarship to "some colledge in
Cambridge" was gradually merged with other
gifts in a general Exhibition Account and it is
only rarely possible to distinguish a holder of
the Clapham Exhibition. Indeed &pound;4 was not
a luxurious sum as time went on.</p>

<p>On June 29th, 1604 Henry Tennant of
Cleatopp, who had already shewn himself
eager for the welfare of the School by
supporting the petition of Christopher Shute
for the confirmation of the Statutes, gave &pound;100
to the Governors of the School. With this
money they were to buy lands or rent charges
"to and for such use, purpose and intent that
the yearly revenues, yssues, and profittes ...
shall and maie be by them ... emploied
first for and towardes the better mantaynance
of Josias Shute, one of the sonnes of the said
Christopher Shute, in Cambridge, until such
tyme as he shall be admitted to be Master of
Arts in the said Universitie, and from yeare to
yeare for ever for and towards the releiving and
mantayninge of such schollers within the
Universitie of Cambridge, one after another
successivelie, as shall be naturallie borne within
the said parish of Giggleswick and instructed<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_53" id="Page_53">[Pg 53]</a></span>
and brought upp to learning at the said free
Grammer Schoole, and as shall be elected and
chosen out of the said Schoole by the Master
and Governors ... to be fitt for that
purpose." Each one was to receive the money
until he became Master of Arts, so long as he
did not defer the time beyond the customary
limit nor remove nor discontinue his place.</p>

<p>This gift Tennant confirmed in his will of
July 5 in the same year with a further gift of
all his lands and hereditaments in Settle and the
"ancient yearlie rent of five shillings be it more or
lesse." This was to "go towards the procuringe
and obtayninge of an Exhibicioun for a poore
scholler or seizer in somme one Colledge in
Cambridge until ... he shall or may be
Bachelor of Arts.... The same poore scholler
to be borne within the parish of Giggleswick and
brought upp at the schoole their att learninge
and to be elected ... by the Maister and
Governors." Clapham's advowsons and rent-charge
were sold by the Governors on June 20,
1604, to "one Symon Paycock, of Barney, and
Robart Claphamson, of Hamworth, in the countie
of Northfolk, clarke" in consideration of the
payment of one hundred marks and the lands
in Settle left by Henry Tennant were sold to
Antonie Procter, of Cleatopp, on January 14, 1604
for &pound;40. These two sums together with Henry
Tennant's former gift of &pound;100 helped to make<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_54" id="Page_54">[Pg 54]</a></span>
up &pound;240, with which the Governors on January
19, 1609, bought a rent-charge of &pound;14 13<i>s.</i> 4<i>d.</i>,
which has been paid them ever since. Being
a rent-charge, it is not liable to fluctuation.</p>

<p>The first elections were made on February 14,
1604. Josias Shute did not take his B.A. degree
till 1605 nor his M.A. till 1609, so that the
clause in Henry Tennant's will referring to
him still held and he was receiving the interest
on &pound;100, but there is also the interest on the
lands in Settle which had been sold for &pound;40
and were bringing in &pound;4 yearlie.</p>

<p>Thomas, one of the sons of Christopher
Shute, and Alexander Bankes, of Austwick,
in the parish of Clapham (also a relative of one
of the Governors) were elected to the two
Exhibitions. But as Clapham's money continued
for seven yeares, they were each to receive &pound;4
a year for four years and to divide the Clapham
Exhibition during the next three years, if both
continued in the University. This was done
"for their better mantaynance and to take awaie
emulation."</p>

<p>Thereafter elections were frequently made,
until the merging of the funds in the general
foundation of the School by the scheme of 1872.</p>

<p>In 1507, the half-acre of land on which
James Carr, capellanus, had built his school had
been leased for seventy-nine years for a yearly
rent of "xij<i>d.</i> of good and lawfull moneye of<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_55" id="Page_55">[Pg 55]</a></span>
England," and when the seventy-nine years
were up, the lease was to be renewable on a
payment of 6<i>s.</i> 8<i>d.</i> Clearly it had been renewed
in 1586 but no record remains. In 1610 "on
the ffourteenth daie of December, Sir Gervysse
Helwysse and Sir Richard Williamson were
owners in ffee farme of the Rectorie and
Parsonage of Giglesweke." Durham had ceased
to possess it, on the Confiscation of Finchale
Priory, and in 1601 Robert Somerskayles had
bought it of the Crown.</p>

<p>Sir Gervysse Helwysse and Sir Richard
Williamson "in consideracion of a certeyne
somme of money to them in hand paid, but
especially at the request and mediacion of the
said Christofer Shutt" sold "all that house
comonly called the Schoolehouse in Giglesweke
afforesaid and that close adioyneing therto, called
the Schoolehouse garth, parcell of the said
Rectorye."</p>

<p>The amount of the "certeyne somme of
monye" is not declared. The land now belonged
to the School, but the xij<i>d.</i> yearly had still to
be paid as part of the fee farm rent, payable
for the Rectory to the King's majesty.</p>

<p>The next important bequest comes from
Richard Carr, Vicar of Hockleigh in Essex, who
died in 1616. He was a great-grandson of the
brother of James, the founder of the School. The
family interest was maintained and at his death<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_56" id="Page_56">[Pg 56]</a></span>
he left a house in Maldon, called Seely House
Grove, with all its appurtenances to his wife
Joan and after her death to the "Societye,
Companie and Corporation of Christe Colledge in
Cambridge." He also bequeathed direct to
the College "a tenement at Hackwell alias
Hawkwell in the Countie of Essex called Mount
Bovers or Munde Bovers."</p>

<p>These lands "during the naturall life of my
foresaid wife, Joane" were to be used for the
provision of five Scholarships at &pound;5 apiece and
after the death of Joane the whole estate was
to provide eight Scholarships at &pound;5, and two
Fellowships at twenty marks (&pound;13 6<i>s.</i> 8<i>d.</i>) apiece.
The Scholarships were to continue until the
holder had time to "commence Master of Arts,"
if he abode so long, and the Fellowships until
they had time to "commence Bachelor of
Divinitie."</p>

<p>The Scholars had to be born in the parish
of Giggleswick or be children "lawfullie begotten
of my brother-in-law, Robert Thornton and my
sister Jeanet, his wife, in the parish of Clapham
and of their children's posteritie for ever." They
must have been brought up in the free School
of Giggleswick and were to be "chosen from
the poorer sort though they be not altogether
so learned, as other scholars, who have richer
friends." If any of the founder's kin were not
immediately ready for the Scholarship, it could<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_57" id="Page_57">[Pg 57]</a></span>
be held over for one year and the amount for
that year distributed among the Sizars of the
College. Never more than four of his kin
might hold the Scholarship at one time.</p>

<p>The Fellowships were to be offered to his
two nephews "Richard Carr, now of Peterhouse,
and Robert Thornton, of Jesus Colledge in
Cambridge." If they should be unable to accept
them the "Maister and Fellowes of Christe
Colledge" shall elect fellows from the number
only of those "who have or at least have had
some of the aforesaid scholarships and none
other to be capable of them."</p>

<p>The College Authorities were asked to
provide convenient chambers and studies for
both Fellows and Scholars and to account them
as Fellows and Scholars of the College.</p>

<p>In consequence of the provision that the
Scholars were to be elected from "the poorer sort"
an agreement was made in 1635 by which those
elected were allowed to receive the &pound;5 and yet go
to another College. For &pound;5 was quite inadequate
and at Christ's "by reason of the poverty of
the holders, no Fellow is found willing to
undertake for them as a Tutor in respect of the
hazard thereof." Tempest Thornton is the only
name recorded as a Giggleswick Fellow and he
held office in 1625. The reason why no other
was ever elected is given in a letter from
Thomas Atherton, Fellow of Christ's, written<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_58" id="Page_58">[Pg 58]</a></span>
May 29, 1718, to Richard Ellershaw, Vicar of
Giggleswick, in which he says that it was "owing
to our having lost that part of the Estate thus
bequeathed us called Seely House Grove, which
was sued for and recovered a great while ago
by some or other that laid claim to it."</p>

<p>The farms in Hockley and Maldon are still
in their possession and one of them retains its
name, Munde Bowers. Never more than six
Scholarships a year had been given and in
1718 the income was &pound;31 a year. In 1890 there
were apparently two Carr Exhibitions of &pound;50
a year each, while at the present day there is
one of &pound;50 tenable for three years, but it is
possible that in a few years another Exhibition
may be given occasionally.</p>

<p>In 1619 the term of Christopher Shute's
Headmastership drew to a close. He resigned
and his place was taken by the Rev. Robert
Dockray. It cannot be ascertained how long
Shute had been Master, for the earliest
expenditure which is entered in the Minute-Book
was in 1615 and therein:</p>

<table style="width:90%;" summary="">
<tr>
<td>Item: to Mr. Shute and Mr. Claphamson for monie that was behind of their wages</td>
<td style="text-align:right;">&pound;1&nbsp;17&nbsp;4</td>
</tr>
</table>

<p>This entry establishes the fact that one
Christopher Shute was Master in 1615 and the
receipts continue in his name for four years
until 1619. Tradition says that the Vicar and<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_59" id="Page_59">[Pg 59]</a></span>
Master were one and the same person, but there
are certain difficulties in the way. In the first
place the Vicar was over seventy years of age,
secondly there is no Grace Book or extant
contemporary writing or extract from the Parish
Registers, in which he is called both Vicar and
Master. Thirdly, the Vicar's son, Josias, is said
to have been educated by his father, until he
was of an age to go to the Grammar School.
On the other hand Shute may have undertaken the
work of the Master for a few years only and
owing to some especial necessity, which has
not been recorded. Secondly there is no
record of any Christopher Shute, other than the
Vicar, who in 1615 could have acted as Master.
Nathaniel Shute had a son Christopher, who
was later a Fellow of Christ's, Cambridge, but
at this date he was still a boy. Thirdly the
signatures in the Minute-Book of both Master
and Vicar are very similar.</p>

<p>The year 1619 is the latest date at which
the Vicar took any active part in the advancement
of the School and his work may be briefly
summarised. With Henry Tennant, he had
petitioned Archbishop Piers for his assent
to the Statutes, which they had drawn up.
In 1599 he had procured a parchment-covered
book, which he called "Liber Christopheri Shute
et amicorum" and in 1604 he presented it to
the School. The book contains elections of<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_60" id="Page_60">[Pg 60]</a></span>
Scholars, elections of Governors, Accounts,
Receipts, etc.; it is not full of important matter,
but is rather a bare record of certain facts.</p>

<p>In 1610 he was responsible with Robert
Bankes and John Robinson for the purchase of
the land on which the School stood, and during
his mastership the Clapham, Tennant and Carr
bequests were made. Such benefactions in
themselves denote the fame of the School, and
the result of its teaching is seen in the pupils
it sent forth.</p>

<p>Nathaniel Shute was born at Giggleswick
"his father, Christopher Shute being the painful
Vicar thereof." He was educated at the School
and went thence to Christ's College, Cambridge;
he became a most excellent scholar and solid
preacher, though nothing of his work remains
save the Corona Caritatis, a sermon preached at
the funeral of Master Fishbourn. He died in 1638.</p>

<p>Josias Shute, born in 1588, was the brother
of Nathaniel and from Giggleswick went on to
Trinity College, Cambridge. In 1611 he
became Rector of S. Mary Wolnoth, Lombard
Street, and remained there over thirty years.
He was "the most precious jewell ever seen in
Lombard Street," but suffered much during the
civil disturbances of the reign. Charles I made
him Archdeacon of Colchester in 1642, and he
died on June 14, 1643. His funeral sermon
was preached by Ephraim Udall.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 394px;">

</div>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_61" id="Page_61">[Pg 61]</a></span></p>

<p>He was a skilled Hebrew scholar a
language which he had probably begun to study
at Giggleswick, and he left many manuscripts
which were posthumously published by his brother
Timothy. While he was still at Cambridge, he
had enjoyed the interest on &pound;100 given by Henry
Tennant and in gratitude therefor and for other
benefits received at the School he left to the
Governors by a will dated June 30, 1642, certain
parcels of land in the parish of Giggleswick,
called Eshton Close, Cappleriggs Close and
Huntwait Fields. The rent of these fields was
to be apportioned in two ways. Five pounds
was to be given yearly to the maintaining of
a poor Scholar of the parish, who had been
educated in the School, at either University
until he became Master of Arts. The remainder
of the rent was to be distributed amongst the poor
of Giggleswick, who were most pious and had
most need. The land increased in value greatly.
In 1683 the rent amounted to &pound;6 8<i>s.</i> 0<i>d.</i>, and in
1697 &pound;7 5<i>s.</i> 10<i>d.</i> Seventy years later it had
almost doubled and in 1806 it was &pound;34 6<i>s.</i> 0<i>d.</i></p>

<p>In the latter year the Governors effected an
exchange. Huntwait was given up for Tarn
Brow and the rent rose five pounds. In spite
of this gradual increase in value, the Governors
only allotted the five pounds to the Exhibition
Fund, the rest went to the poor of Giggleswick,
to be distributed on the day of the Purification<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_62" id="Page_62">[Pg 62]</a></span>
of the Virgin Mary. The five pounds was as
a rule paid as an extra Exhibition in addition to
the sum received from the Burton rent-charge,
which had been bought with the money left by
William Clapham and Henry Tennant, and the
recipients were often especially mentioned as
poor, notably in 1652 and again in 1673.</p>

<p>On December 13, 1872, Tarn Brow was
sold for &pound;1,000 and apportioned to pay part of
the cost of the buildings which were then being
erected. The Governors were directed to pay
three-and-a-half per cent. interest on the sum
expended. Cappleriggs was let for &pound;20 a year
and Eshton for &pound;11.</p>

<p>The whole income now arising from these
sources is applied in providing certain boys with
total exemptions from payment of tuition fees
and the costs of books and stationery: they are
called Shute Exhibitions and are offered in
the first instance to boys who are in attendance at
a Public Elementary School in the ancient
parish of Giggleswick.</p>

<p>Christopher Shute had three other sons
who were all ministers of the Church and were
"all great (though not equal) Lights, set up in
fair Candlesticks."</p>

<p>He had done his duty as a Father, he
had more than done his duty as Vicar and
Governor. It is unfortunate that there is no
portrait of him, for it would then be possible<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_63" id="Page_63">[Pg 63]</a></span>
to discern the scholarly and courtly grace
of the man under whom the School more than
it had ever done before or was to do again until
the nineteenth century flourished and prospered
and grew notable. He died, still Vicar and
Governor, in 1626. "Happy a father who had
his quiver full with five such sons."</p>

<p>The Rev. Robert Dockray succeeded in 1619
as Master, and Henry Claphamson, who had
been Usher certainly since 1615, possibly earlier
though no records exist, continued in the office.
The pay of both had increased since 1592. The
Ancient Statutes of that date give the stipend
of the Master as twenty marks (&pound;13 6<i>s.</i> 8<i>d.</i>),
and of the Usher as &pound;6 13<i>s.</i> 4<i>d.</i>, with power to
the Governors to increase it. It cannot be
ascertained when a change was made but in the
half-year Accounts for 1617 there occurs the
entry:</p>

<p class="center smaller">Item: to the Maister and Usher, xv<i>li.</i></p>

<p>Robert Dockray and Henry Claphamson
never received less than &pound;20 and &pound;10 yearly
apiece after 1619. In 1629 they received an
additional gratuity, the Master, of twenty nobles,
<i>i.e.</i> &pound;6 13<i>s.</i> 4<i>d.</i> and the Usher, of &pound;3 6<i>s.</i> 8<i>d.</i></p>

<p>The School went on its uneventful way.
Dockray, the Master, became Vicar and made his
protestation as an ex-officio Governor in 1632.
In August, 1635, Christopher Lascelles, of<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_64" id="Page_64">[Pg 64]</a></span>
Ripon, gentleman, received &pound;20 in consideration
of some request he made concerning troubles
which he had been put to but which he does
not specify. For the rest Governors succeeded
Governors, Scholars were sent to the University
with aid from the Exhibition money, Master
and Usher receipted their wages each half year.
The year 1640, is the last in which Robert
Dockray appears as a Governor and his last
receipt for his wages is dated March of the
same year. Henry Claphamson succeeded to his
work temporarily for eighteen weeks, receiving
10<i>s.</i> 3<i>d.</i> a week, but himself died before August
1642. Anthony Lister, the Vicar, taught for
just over six months at the same rate, and on
August 25, 1642, the Rev. Rowland Lucas had
earned &pound;9 12<i>s.</i> 0<i>d.</i> as "head scoulmaster."</p>

<p>The Usher's place was taken by William
son of Thomas Wilsonne, "Agricol&aelig;" in
Giggleswick. He had been at the School for
ten years under Mr. Dockray and at the age
of eighteen had gone up to S. John's, Cambridge,
as a Sizar in 1639. Thence he went back to
his old School in 1642 and remained there for
twenty-four years.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_65" id="Page_65">[Pg 65]</a></span></p>

<h3><a name="Chapter_V" id="Chapter_V"></a><span class="smcap">Chapter V.</span></h3>

<h2>1642&mdash;1712.</h2>


<p><span class="dropcap">T</span>HE Rev. Rowland Lucas was a native of
Westmorland and had been educated at
Kirkby under Mr. Leake. In 1626 he
was admitted to Christ's College, Cambridge,
as a Sizar and took his B.A. in three years and
his M.A. in 1633. Before he came to Giggleswick
he had been Headmaster of Heversham. In
1643 his salary was increased to forty marks
and in 1645 to &pound;40, and during his six years
many scholars went to Cambridge and won
distinction in the world, such as Thomas
Dockray and John Carr. At his death in 1648,
William Wilsonne, the Usher, supplied his place
for a few weeks and later William Walker was
elected. He was a native of Giggleswick and
had been a boy at the School under Mr. Lucas.
In 1643 at the age of eighteen he was admitted
as a Sizar at Christ's and commenced B.A.
1646-7 and later M.A.</p>

<p>The numbers of the School at this period
are quite uncertain. The accommodation was
slight and the teaching staff limited to the
Master and Usher, but the boys were probably
packed very close. During the nine years
of his mastership, boys were steadily sent<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_66" id="Page_66">[Pg 66]</a></span>
to Cambridge. Christ's alone admitted twenty-five
and in one single year (1652) three others
entered S. John's. These boys were sons
of really poor men. John Cockett in 1651 was
the first recorded receiver of the Shute
Exhibition of &pound;5, and in the next year it was
given to Josias Dockray, son of the late Master,
"whom we conceive to be a poore scoller of
our parish." Both these boys became ordained
and in time were appointed to one or more
livings. For a century and a half Giggleswick
fed Christ's with a steady stream of boys who
almost without exception entered the service
of the Church.</p>

<p>Seventeenth century Giggleswick took no
heed of the progress of the School and records
do not abound. It was a disturbed period in
English history and political and religious
troubles occupied men's minds to the exclusion
of lesser matters. Giggleswick was nevertheless
well-known, for in 1697 Abraham de la Prynne
records in his diary an anecdote of a Mr. Hollins
who thirty years before had lived at Giggleswick
"as I remember in Yorkshire where the great
school is." Apparently Anthony Lister, who
was then Vicar had roused the resentment of
a particular Quaker, who found himself anxious
to go to the Parish Church to rebuke Lister
publicly, when he began to preach. On his way
thither he met a friend and told him<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_67" id="Page_67">[Pg 67]</a></span>
of his intention. The man tried to dissuade
him but finding argument of no avail, he asked
him what induced him to choose this particular
Sunday. Whereupon the Quaker replied that
"the Spirit" had sent him. The rejoinder came
quickly "why did the Spirit not also tell thee
that one Roger and not the Vicar is preaching
to-day?" There was at this period one
particularly distinguished son of Giggleswick,
Richard Frankland born at "Rothmel&aelig;"
(Rathmell) in 1631 who came to the School when
he was nine and at the age of seventeen went
as a Burton Exhibitioner to Christ's College,
Cambridge. The Shute Minute-Book of 1651
has the following entry:</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p class="center">xxj<i>st</i> January, 1651.</p>

<p>Received the day and yeare abovesaid from Robt.
Claphamson the some of eight pounds which he
received of James Smith, of Burton, for one year's
rent, the which is disbursed by us as follows (to witt)
to Jane ffrankland for her son, viz. xl<i>s.</i></p></div>

<p>His father John Frankland is said on his
tombstone in Giggleswick Church to be one of
the Franklands of "Thartilbe" (Thirkleby,
near Thirsk) and he was admitted to Christ's
in 1626.</p>

<p>Richard became B.A. in 1651 and M.A.
four years later. In 1653 he was "set apart"
and received Presbyterian ordination. He was
immediately appointed Vicar of Auckland S.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_68" id="Page_68">[Pg 68]</a></span>
Andrew by Sir Arthur Haselrig but was ejected
nine years later. He was not an extreme man but
he refused to be re-ordained by Bishop Cosen.
After the second Conventicle Act of 1670 he
made a personal appeal to Charles II, "to
reform your life, your family, your kingdom and
the Church." The King was much moved and
replied "I thank you, Sir," and twice looking
back before he went into the Council Chamber
said "I thank you, Sir; I thank you." Returning
to Rathmell his native place, Frankland opened
an Academy, where he gave an University
training in Divinity, Law or Medicine. Aristotle
was taught and one tutor was a Ramist. The
lectures were delivered in Latin. His pupils were
not confined to any one denomination, but
included Puritans, Presbyterians and Independents.</p>

</div>

<p>Fortune smiled very grimly upon him and
he was compelled to change his place of
instruction on many occasions. His pupils
always followed him. One Archbishop excommunicated
him, another&mdash;Archbishop Sharpe&mdash;also
a Christ's man, discussed the matter with
the help of tobacco and a bottle of wine. Sharpe's
main objection was that a second school was
not required so close to Giggleswick, and an
Academy for public instruction in University
Learning could not lawfully receive a Bishop's
license. In the main he was undisturbed during
his last years and when he died in 1698 over<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_69" id="Page_69">[Pg 69]</a></span>
three hundred pupils had passed through his
hands and his Academy was later transferred to
Manchester and in 1889 to Oxford, where it
became known as the Manchester New College.
During the period of Frankland's struggles with
the dignitaries of the Church, one Samuel Watson,
of Stainforth, who had been a Governor of
Giggleswick School was in 1661 "willing being
a Quaker that another should be elected in his
place." Eight years later he interrupted a
service in the Parish Church, and the people
"brok his head upon ye seates."</p>

<p>In 1656 William Walker resigned the
mastership and for three months his place was
taken by William Bradley, who had been a
pensioner at S. John's, Cambridge, at the same
time as the Usher, William Wilsonne. William
Brigge was then elected. He was an University
man and almost certainly at Cambridge, but
his college is doubtful.</p>

<p>In 1659 the Shute Scholarship was to be
given "to Tho. Green's son of Stainforth, when
a certificate comes of his admittance" into the
University. This was a precaution that was
not unnecessary. It is only rarely that the
money is entered as being paid to the scholar
himself: far more often is it paid to the father
or mother and sometimes to the boy's college
Tutor. On March 12, 1660, it is agreed "that
the &pound;5 is to be paid to Tho. Gibson, his<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_70" id="Page_70">[Pg 70]</a></span>
Tutor, upon his admittance into the Collidge."
In 1673, Hugh, son of Oliver Stackhouse,
"being ye poorest scoller" was awarded the money.</p>

<p>The North Cave Estate, which had been
given to the School as part of its endowment in
1553, had very greatly increased in value during
the hundred years to 1671, when the rents
amounted to over &pound;80. The stipends of the
Masters were raised by means of a gratuity and
William Brigge received &pound;30. No reason
appears why after fifteen years' service and an
increased gratuity he should still be receiving
&pound;10 a year less than one of his predecessors,
Rowland Lucas, in 1644.</p>

<p>Thomas Wildeman, the Usher, received
&pound;15. Wilson had died in 1666 and one
William Cowgill, of whom we know nothing,
succeeded him for four years. In 1671
Wildeman took his place. One Thomas
Wildeman had been at Giggleswick as a boy and
had entered Magdalene, Cambridge, in 1670,
and then migrated to Christ's. The dates make
it possible that they are the same person, in
which case he would be continuing to keep his
terms at Cambridge and be acting as Usher at
the same time.</p>

<p>The Accounts of the School at this period
shew the Governors in a different light. Their
expenditure not having increased proportionately
to their income, the surplus money was<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_71" id="Page_71">[Pg 71]</a></span>
lent out at interest to the people in the village.
Hugh Stackhouse, who had gone up to
Christ's with school money on account of his
great poverty, was at this time acting as
Treasurer or Clerk and was one of the earliest
to take advantage of the Governors' enterprize.
He borrowed &pound;10 at five per cent. and the debt
continues to be mentioned for many years. He
would appear to be a privileged debtor.</p>

<p>The following is a typical entry in the
Account Book:</p>

<p>The Mr. Wildman here referred to may have
been the Usher, who belonged to a Giggleswick
family but had given up the post of Usher,
which at this date was held by John Sparke
formerly of Christ's and possibly the same as the
John Sparke who was Vicar of Long Preston in
1703. William Brigge had also left in 1684 and
for six months his work was taken by a former<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_72" id="Page_72">[Pg 72]</a></span>
Usher, John Parkinson, who had matriculated
as a Sizar at Christ's in 1676 and after taking
his degree came for two years as Usher in
place of Wildeman. On Brigge's death he acted
as Headmaster, but whether he was definitely
appointed such or was intended to be in charge
for a short time only is doubtful, as he died
in six months.</p>

<p class="center smaller">June 12, 1685. "Mr John Armittsteade entred to ye Schole."</p>

<p>John Armitstead was born at Long Preston
in 1660, and after being at Giggleswick as a
boy, he went up to Cambridge at the age of
nineteen with a Burton Exhibition. He was
entered as a Sizar at Christ's, and commenced
B.A. in 1682-3 and M.A. 1688. The name of
Armitstead has been very closely connected with
the School even to the present day.</p>

<p>Henry Roome was Usher for one quarter in
1688 and then gave place to Richard Atkinson
or Akinson, whose salary varied from year to
year, but never exceeded a certain limit, viz.: just
half the Master's, which consisted of "ye ancient
Master's Stipend" of twenty marks and a gratuity
which brought it between &pound;40 and &pound;50. There
are also small entries in places, such as:</p>

<p class="center smaller">October 1, 1687.</p>

<p class="blockquot">Paid to Mr. Armitstead for repairs about ye schoole
loft and garden that he had laid out, as particulars
may appeare, which noate of particulars he delivered<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_73" id="Page_73">[Pg 73]</a></span>
to ye summe of &pound;4 17<i>s.</i> 06<i>d.</i> In which noate theire
was a Presse that stands in ye schoole chamber, it is
theire to remaine to belonge to ye schoole.</p>

<p>Richard Ellershaw, the Vicar, took a very
great interest in the School, and in 1718 he
wrote to Christ's College, Cambridge, seeking
information about the Carr Scholarships. It
was probably due to him that in 1693 two
shillings was laid down for transcribing part of
Carr's Will, which money "the schollars that
receive Burton Exhibitions must then (i.e. 1694)
allow to the school stock."</p>

<p>One point of interest remains connected
with this period: it is a curious slip of paper
without date, which contains an invitation to the
reader, whoever he may have been, to visit the
writer J.N. in the country. It is written on
the back of some of Armitstead's accounts, with
an alternative version by its side, which was
no doubt a revised copy of the theme after
correction by the Master:</p>

<p>The money left to the School by Josias
Shute was in part intended to be paid to the
poor of the parish, together with two further
sums of five shillings left by William Clapham
and nine shillings by Mr. Thornton for the
same purpose. It is difficult to note the payment
of these sums, for they were as a rule added
together and entered as "For the Poor Fund,"
but in 1695 there was paid to:</p>

<p>Shute's surplus was certainly given to the
poor in some years but there is no consistent
record and by the scheme made under the
Endowed Schools Acts it ceased. In 1692
"Arthur, son of Joshua Whitaker, of Settle,
appearing to us to be ye poorest schollar that
stood candidate for ye said gift" was allowed
the Shute Exhibition of &pound;5. He also received
&pound;7 of the Burton Rents, and in May, 1698, as
much as &pound;9 10<i>s.</i> 0<i>d.</i> With these sums he was
enabled to go to Christ's College, Cambridge,
where he gained a Scholarship and by the year<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_75" id="Page_75">[Pg 75]</a></span>
1698 in March, which under the new style
would be March 1699, he had returned to the
School as Usher, in succession to Richard
Akinson. He taught for fifteen years and
received as usual, just half the Headmaster's
stipend, the amount varying between &pound;23 and &pound;27.
On March 12, 1712, the following entry occurs:
"Recd of ye Governors of ye free Gramar School
of Gigleswick ye sum of two pounds eighteen
shillings and sixpence for ye use of my brother
Wm. Foster, now Curate of Horsefield," but
it turns out to be a payment of that part of
the Exhibition to which he was entitled, up till
the time he had left Cambridge, presumably
in the previous June.</p>

<p>John Armitstead's receipts end in 1704, and
he died in 1712. It is impossible to determine
the worth of a Master, when so few documents
remain to judge him, but the Governors of
1768 thought fit to refer to "the artful and
imperious temper of Mr. Armitstead." Their
particular grievance was that in 1704 the
Governors had a balance of &pound;230 with which
they purchased a farm called Keasden. This
they let and its profits went to the Master and
Usher, and in 1712 the "easy, complying
disposition of the Governors" was persuaded to
allow the Master to collect the rents of all the
lands belonging to the School and simply enter
a receipt "of the wages now due to us."<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_76" id="Page_76">[Pg 76]</a></span>
Consequently no accounts were kept from 1704
till 1765, and because there was no reserve fund
presumably no repairs were done. The Master
collected the rents and with his Usher divided
the spoil. He even seized the &pound;15 which
remained over from the purchase money of the
Keasden farm. Nor was this all. Up to the
year 1705 the Master paid for the expenses of
the Governors' Meetings but in that year the
Governors were persuaded to deduct sixpence in
the pound from the Exhibitions given to the
boys going up to the Universities. This
deduction continued till the nineteenth century.
Judging then from the opinions of the Governors
fifty years later, John Armitstead was not wholly
an altruist. It is still more unfortunate that
his evil lived after him.</p>

<p>The number of Scholars, who went up to
Cambridge in his time though less than it had
been, was still considerable. During his twenty-eight
years, as many as twenty-seven went to
Christ's alone, including the first Paley who
is known to have been educated at the School.
The greater proportion always went to Christ's
until the last decade of the eighteenth century,
but other Colleges received them also, notably
at certain periods S. John's.</p>

<h2>The Eighteenth Century.</h2>


<p><span class="dropcap">J</span>ohn Armitstead ceased to acknowledge the
receipt of his wages in 1704 and died in
1712. Just as he had belonged to a local
family and had been educated at the School
and Christ's College, Cambridge, so was his
successor.</p>

<p>John Carr, A.B., late of Stackhouse, was a
descendant of the original James and Richard
Carr and was thus the third member of the
family to hold the Mastership. He had been
elected to the combined Exhibitions from the
School in 1707, and after taking his degree he
was ordained Deacon at York in 1713 and Priest
in 1720. On June 18, 1712, as a layman and at the
age of twenty-three he entered upon his duties
as Master. Seven days later a relative, of what
degree is uncertain, William Carr, of Langcliffe,
was elected a Governor, and eight years later
another William Carr, of Stackhouse, and hence
probably a closer connexion, possibly his father,
was also made a Governor. In 1726 George
Carr was made Usher. The family circle was
complete.</p>

<p>After 1704 the position of Usher had been
successively filled by Anthony Weatherhead, a<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_78" id="Page_78">[Pg 78]</a></span>
former pupil of Armitstead's and a B.A. of
Christ's, by Thos. Rathmell from whom there are
no receipts but who died in 1712, and by Richard
Thornton, who held it for fourteen years. There
is no record that he was ever a member of
the School as a boy, but it is a legitimate
conjecture, when it is remembered that the
Thorntons were an old family in the neighbourhood,
and one of them figures in the
Minute-Book, 1692, as having left nine shillings
to the Giggleswick poor.</p>

<p>On the day on which John Carr was elected
Master he had to sign an agreement in the
following terms:</p>

<p class="center smaller">June 18, 1712.</p>

<p class="center smaller">Conditions on which a master shall be chosen.</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<ol>
<li>He shall observe all the statutes of the schoole.</li>

<li>And particularly the writing master shall hereafter
be chosen by ye Governours at the usuall day of
meeting in March and ye time to be appointed
by the Master, as has been formerly practic'd.</li>

<li>That the masters shall, upon receipt of any moneys
from Northcave, Rise, etc., acquaint at least one
of ye Governours, when such moneys are paid
to them, give the said Governour or Governours
an acquittance under their hands, and ye moneys
receiv'd to be entred into the schoole booke and
the private acquittance given to be delivered back
to the masters on the day of meeting in march
aforesaid.</li>

<li>That ye masters shall take the rents of the
Keasden lands, when due, and give an acquittance
for the same to the Governours on the usuall day
of March.</li>

<li>Whereas ye statutes enjoyn that the Governours,
when they meet about ye business of ye school,
shall be content with moderate charges, it is
agreed that those moderate charges on ye usuall
day of meeting in March shall not exceed at any
one meeting the sum of one pound per Annum.</li>
</ol>

<p>To ye above written articles, I, John Carr, A.B.,
give my consent and promise to observe them.</p>

<p class="signature"><span class="smcap">John Carr.</span></p></div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_79" id="Page_79">[Pg 79]</a></span></p>

<p>It cannot be explained why these regulations
were made, but probably the real point of friction
had lain in the collection of rents, or perhaps in
the choice of the Writing Master. It is clear
from the second clause that the original custom
has not changed much. The Ancient Statutes
of 1592 had given the Master power to appoint
a three weeks vacation, when he wished, in
order that the "scollers" might "be exercysed
in wrytinge under a scriviner" and it is the
same in 1712. It proves that, although the
School was a free school and was the place of
education for the whole township of Giggleswick
and the surrounding neighbourhood, it was not
a place for elementary education and never had
been.</p>

<p>The fifth paragraph bears reference to the
agreement made with John Armitstead in 1705,
by which the Masters ceased to provide the
entertainment at the Governors' Meetings.
Henceforward the amount to be expended is
limited to one pound per annum.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_80" id="Page_80">[Pg 80]</a></span></p>

<p>In 1720 Richard Thornton was allowed to
act as Clerk to Charles Harris, Esq., for six
months. It does not transpire who Charles
Harris was, but the case is somewhat paralleled
seventy years later, when in 1793 Robert Kidd
is "to take the trouble of keeping accounts, etc.,
for the Governors and be allowed an additional
sum of two guineas per annum."</p>

<p>In 1726 Richard Thornton resigned and
George Carr took his place. Nothing worthy
of note is recorded until John Carr's death in
1744, save that in 1728 the said John Carr
received &pound;1 11<i>s.</i> 8<i>d.</i>, "to be laid out in building
a little house for ye use of ye schoole," but
what it was, is not known. The number of boys
going up to the Universities in Carr's time fell
off unaccountably, though they included John
Cookson whose entry "probe edoctus" in the
Christ's College Admission Book testifies to
the teaching in the School.</p>

<p>Carr died in 1743 and was succeeded by
William Paley. Born at Langcliffe, educated at
the School and admitted into Christ's as a Sizar
with a Burton Exhibition in 1729-30, William
Paley gained a Scholarship there two years
later. He became ordained and was made Vicar
of Helpston, Peterborough, where his eldest
son was born. He remained Vicar for sixty-four
years till his death and combined the living
with the Headmastership of Giggleswick and<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_81" id="Page_81">[Pg 81]</a></span>
for twenty years with a Curacy at the Parish
Church.</p>

<p>His family had lived at Langcliffe for some
considerable time and from 1670 to 1720 the
name is never absent from the School Minute-Book.
"Altogether a schoolmaster both by
long habit and inclination, irritable and a
disciplinarian. Cheerful and jocose, a great wit,
rather coarse in his language," Such is his
grandson's description of him. "And when at
the age of eighty-three or eighty-four he was
obliged to have assistance (which was long
before he wanted it in his own opinion) he
used to be wheeled in a chair to his School:
and even in the delirium of his last sickness
insisted on giving his daughters a Greek
author, over which they would mumble and
mutter to persuade him that he was still
hearing his boys Greek."</p>

<p>"He was found sitting in the hayfield
among his workpeople, or sitting in his elbow-chair
nibbling his stick, or with the tail of
his damask gown rolled into his pocket busying
himself in his garden even at the age of eighty."</p>

<p>In 1742 he married Elizabeth Clapham, of
Stackhouse, who was also a member of an old
Giggleswick family. She is said to have ridden on
horseback behind her husband from Stackhouse
to Peterborough. She was the most affectionate
and careful of parents, a little, shrewd-looking,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_82" id="Page_82">[Pg 82]</a></span>
keen-eyed woman of remarkable strength of
mind and spirits, one of those positive
characters that decide promptly and execute at
once, of a sanguine and irritable temper that
led her to be always on the alert in thinking
and acting. She also had a fortune of &pound;400,
which in this neighbourhood was almost sufficient
to confer the title of an heiress (<i>Some Craven
Worthies</i>).</p>

<span class="caption">ARCHDEACON PALEY.</span>
</div>

<p>Their son was William Paley, Archdeacon
of Carlisle and author of "Evidences of
Christianity." Born in 1744 he went to Christ's
College at the age of fifteen, with a Burton
Exhibition and received a Carr Scholarship,
when he entered. As a boy he had been a fair
scholar with eccentric habits. His great delight
was in cock-fighting and he must have looked
forward to each Potation Day, March 12, with
considerable joy. There are many anecdotes
about him. He is supposed, whilst in company
with his father riding on his way to Cambridge
to have fallen off his horse seven times, whereupon
his father would merely call out "take care of
thy money, lad." His mind was always original,
indeed he was never regarded as a "safe" man
and in consequence he did not attain that high
position in the Church that his intellectual
achievements entitled him to expect. When
about to take his B.A. degree he proposed to
write a thesis on "Aeternitas p&oelig;narum con<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_83" id="Page_83">[Pg 83]</a></span>tradicit
divinis attributis," but the Master of
Christ's was so distressed that Paley was
induced to appease him by the insertion of
a "non." In 1765 he gained the Member's
Prize as Senior Bachelor with a Latin essay
which had long English notes. One of the
examiners condemned it, because "he supposed
the author had been assisted by his father,
some country clergyman, who having forgotten
his Latin had written the notes in English."
Powell, the Master of S. John's, a learned
doctor and the oracle of Cambridge on every
question concerning subscription to the faith,
spoke warmly in its favour "it contained more
matter than was to be found in all the others
... it would be unfair to reject such a
dissertation on mere suspicion, since the notes
were applicable to the subject and shewed the
author to be a young man of the most promising
abilities and extensive reading." This opinion
turned the balance in Paley's favour (<i>Baker's
History of S. John's</i>). It also justified the father's
opinion of his son. For when the younger
Paley went to Cambridge, his father exclaimed
that he would be "a great man, a very great
man: for he has by far the cleverest head I ever
met with in my life." He became Senior
Wrangler.</p>

<p>The highest position he attained in the
Church was the Archdeaconry of Carlisle, though<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_84" id="Page_84">[Pg 84]</a></span>
he could have become Master of S. John's College,
Cambridge, if an University life had attracted
him, but it never did. He had left it, while
quite young, to become Rector of Musgrave,
Cumberland, at &pound;80 a year. In 1805 he died,
Giggleswick's most distinguished son.</p>

<p>William Paley was soon to discover the
nature of the Governing Body. Charles Nowell,
one of the kin of the second founder, was
confined in Lancaster Gaol for some offence
which is not recorded and there results a neat
little comedy:</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p class="center">April 25, 1745.</p>

<p>Willm. Banks, of Feizer, elected in the room of
Charles Nowell, of Capleside (now being and having
been long confined in Lancaster Gaol) having in the
presence of us taken the accustomed oath.</p>

<p class="signature">

</p>


<p class="center">May 20, 1745.</p>

<p>Be it remembered that the said William Banks
on the said twenty-fifth day of April, having some
doubt within himself whether he was legally elected,
the above-named Charles Nowell not having resigned,
he did not take the oath required by the Statutes of
the ffree School of Giggleswick but on this day, being
satisfied that his election was legal, he took the said
oath before us (the Vicar and other Governors withdrawing
themselves).</p>

</p></div>

<p>Twenty years passed and another question
arose to engender bitter feelings in the hearts
of the Governors and Masters. In 1755 George
Carr ceased to be Usher and John Moore took
his place. As far as can be known, Moore had
not been educated at the School, certainly he
had not gone up to Christ's with a Burton
Exhibition. For some years Master and Usher
worked together for stipends respectively of
&pound;90 and &pound;45, according to the regular method
by which the Master received double the pay
of the Usher. They had been accustomed to
make an acknowledgment of "all ye wages now
due to us as masters." But the Statutes of
1592 had declared the Master's wage to be
&pound;13 6<i>s.</i> 8<i>d.</i> and accordingly the Governors in
1768 proposed to emphasize the additional sum,
as being given of grace. They brought forward
a draft receipt acknowledging the payment of
&pound;13 6<i>s.</i> 8<i>d.</i> "being a year's salary as Headmaster;
and likewise from the said Governors &pound;83 6<i>s.</i> 8<i>d.</i>
as a gratuity and encouragement for my
diligence." This they required Paley to sign,
and a similar one was drafted for Moore. Both
Masters refused. The Governors then decided
that they "cannot consistently with their trust<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_86" id="Page_86">[Pg 86]</a></span>
pay the Master and Usher any more money
than is fixed for their stipend by the Statutes."
Three months later a meeting was called to take
into consideration a letter from the Archbishop
of York in answer to an appeal from both
parties, and the following minute records their
decision:</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>"It is resolved by us, whose names are subscribed,
punctually to comply with and put into execution to
the utmost of our power the very judicious and
friendly opinions and advice given by the Archbishop
in his letter."</p></div>

<p>The minute is signed by six Governors
and the two Masters and on the next page the
receipts are given as they always had been
before, though the few pounds extra that each
was to have received are not paid. The very
"judicious" letter of Archbishop Drummond
not only fixed the salary of the Master and the
Usher but gives some additional information.
The rents had increased to above &pound;140 a year
and of this the Master and Usher were to be
given &pound;135 and as the rents increased so should
the salaries, always leaving a sufficient surplus
for the Repairs Fund.</p>

<p>The School, he added, had a small number
of scholars, which "may be accounted for by
various causes" and was not due to the teaching
to which he paid a graceful compliment. He
further suggested that the Usher should take it<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_87" id="Page_87">[Pg 87]</a></span>
upon himself to teach Writing, Arithmetic,
and Merchants' Accounts, the first elements of
Mathematics, and the parts that lead to
Mensuration and Navigation.</p>

<p>With regard to the Governors, he counselled
them to meet annually on May 2, quite apart
from their ordinary meetings and make up
their accounts and submit a review of the same
and of the past year's work to the Archbishop.
Secondly they should draw up fresh Statutes.
He was anticipating the Governors' action of
thirty years later. The Scholars, he noted, had
no pew in the Church. Some should be procured
and the Scholars should "goe there regularly
under the eye of the Master or Usher or some
Upper Boy, who should note the absentees."
Altogether the word "judicious," applied to the
letter by the Governors, was justified.</p>

<p>Largely by the work of Arthur Young, the
old system of cultivation by open fields had been
changing, and by the beginning of the reign
of George III it was chiefly the North of
England that still continued after the older
fashion. People were content to make a living,
they did not concentrate their thoughts on
wealth. But in 1764 the tide of reform had
reached the Governors' East Riding Estates
in North Cave and Rise, and a private Act
was passed through Parliament, ordering that
the separate possessions should be marked off<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_88" id="Page_88">[Pg 88]</a></span>
and enclosed. This Act involved a very
considerable expense and the Governors, being
unable to meet it out of their income, on
August 26, 1766, mortgaged their East Riding
Estates to Henry Tennant, of Gargrave. The
acreage was three hundred and ninety-five
acres one rood and the mortgage was concluded
for &pound;1,120 for one thousand years. The
whole of the money was at once expended;
and nearly &pound;500 was appropriated by what
Arthur Young called "the knavery of Commissioners
and Attorneys."</p>

<p>The income of the Governors rose immediately,
in 1766 their rent receipts amounted roughly to
&pound;208 and eleven years later to &pound;347 while in
1780 &pound;400 would be a closer estimate.</p>

<p>The Shute Exhibition rents had also
increased steadily. In 1739 they were &pound;9 4<i>s.</i> 6<i>d.</i>,
twenty-five years later &pound;13 9<i>s.</i> and in 1786
over &pound;15. The Masters' salaries were therefore
increased. In 1768 the Archbishop had fixed
the minimum of Master and Usher at &pound;90 and
&pound;45. A few years later &pound;96 was given and
in 1776 the sums of &pound;151 and &pound;75, each with
a few shillings. In 1784 a new scheme was
evolved, William Paley received &pound;180, John
Moore's successor&mdash;Smith&mdash;&pound;70, and a third
Master who was apparently engaged to teach
Writing and Accounts, and first appears in 1786,
received &pound;20 a year.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_89" id="Page_89">[Pg 89]</a></span></p>

<p>Expenditure in every direction increased, and
an agent, William Iveson, had to be retained to
look after the North Cave Estates, at a salary
of &pound;1 10<i>s.</i> Repairs to the School became more
extensive, Vincent Hallpike was required to make
a "box for the Charter," and the Governors made
more frequent journeys to their estates, no
doubt as a result of the increased facility and
diminished expense of travelling, which was a
notable feature of the latter part of the eighteenth
century. Further they had engaged a third
Master, but whether this was due to a slight
decrease of attention paid to the School by the
Master&mdash;and it is well to remember that he was
still Curate of Giggleswick and Vicar of Helpston,
Peterborough&mdash;or due to a real increase in the
numbers and requirements of the School is not
stated. Several indications point to an increase
in the efficiency of the School. In 1783, an
advertisement was drafted and published for
the appointment of an Usher, whereas before
this time they had been content as a rule to
take the most promising of those who had
recently left the School. Advertising now gave
them a wider field of choice. A Lexicon and
a Dictionary were bought in the following year
for &pound;1 8<i>s.</i> 6<i>d.</i>, as well they might be, for the
last occasion on which books are recorded to
have been bought was in 1626, when the
Governors had expended &pound;3 7<i>s.</i><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_90" id="Page_90">[Pg 90]</a></span></p>

<p>The Exhibition fund, which came from the
rents of the land given by Josias Shute together
with the Burton rents and a rent-charge of
3<i>s.</i> 6<i>d.</i> on Thos. Paley's house in Langcliffe,
had been gradually accumulating. Few
Exhibitions were given and the surplus was
put into the capital account. In 1780 the
general fund borrowed &pound;160 from the Exhibition
money in order to enclose some new allotments
in Walling Fen, in accordance with an Act of
Parliament. The result was startling. The
first year gave them a new rent-roll of &pound;40,
the second year saw this sum doubled.</p>

<p>For a hundred and seventy-five years James
Carr's "low, small and irregular" building had
sufficed for the needs of the School. "Deep
in the shady sadness of a vale" it had witnessed
the gradual change of the Reformation, it had
inspired one of the leaders of Puritan Nonconformity,
it had seen the child growth of a
great theologian and, more than all, it had
roused the imagination and fostered the mental
growth of hundreds of the yeomen and cottagers
of the North of England. But now its work
was accomplished. Flushed with new-found
wealth, full of a vague aspiration after progress,
conscious perhaps of real deficiencies in the
old building, these late eighteenth century
Governors spoiled the "many glories of immortal
stamp." Carelessly they destroyed the ancient<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_91" id="Page_91">[Pg 91]</a></span>
building, without a line to record its glory or
its age. It was left to a nameless "Investigator
C," in the pages of the <i>Gentleman's Magazine</i>
to tell the world what it was losing. Future
dreams oversoared past deeds.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 560px;">
<img src="images/image0091.png" width="560" height="427" alt="SECOND SCHOOL, 1790." title="" />
<span class="caption">SECOND SCHOOL, 1790.</span>
</div>

<p>No minutes survive, but the accounts of
the year 1787 describe the expenditure on a
new building. Three years later the last item
was paid for and a new school-house was
standing on the site of the old. It was very
solidly built and larger than its predecessor.
Over the door was fixed the stone on which
the Hexameter inscription "Alma dei mater,
defende malis Jacobum Kar" etc., was written,
and which had already adorned the face of the
old building so long. The old division of an
upper and lower school was retained, but
otherwise details are few. The new School
was built at a cost of &pound;276 16<i>s.</i> 8&frac14;<i>d.</i> and
served its purpose for over sixty years, when
it was then itself replaced in 1851.</p>

<p>With new school buildings, greatly increased
revenues and a third Master&mdash;Mr. Saul&mdash;appointed
in 1784 with the privity of the Archbishop of
York but not licensed&mdash;the Governors were
eager to get additional statutory power to
increase the teaching staff and pay the surplus
money away both in leaving Exhibitions and in
gratuities to the Scholars at the School by way
of encouragement. There is a letter extant<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_92" id="Page_92">[Pg 92]</a></span>
addressed in November, 1794, by the Clerk to
the Governors to Mr. Clough, who was requested
to lay the whole matter before Mr. Withers
and get his legal opinion.</p>

<p>The letter reads as follows, after first
quoting the Charter and also the Statutes of
1592, which limited the stipend of the Master
to &pound;13 6<i>s.</i> 8<i>d.</i> and of the Usher to &pound;6 13<i>s.</i> 4<i>d.</i></p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>The Revenues of the said School have for sometime
been betwixt three and four hundred pounds a year,
but upon the Governors lately re-letting the several
farms belonging the School, the Revenues will be
advanced to about seven hundred pounds a year.</p>

<p>The Governors have with the privity of the late
Archbishop of York for a number of years employed
a third Master to teach Writing, and Accompts. As
the Revenues of the said School are now so much
advanced, viz: from about &pound;350 to &pound;700 a year, the
Governors of the sd School are desirous with the
consent of the Archbishop of York to make some
additional Statutes in pursuance of the sd Charter,
authorizing them to engage more assistants at the
sd School to teach different branches of literature.</p>

<p>The Governors propose by the new Statutes to be
made that the Head Master's stipend shall not be less
than &pound;200 a year and the Usher's stipend not less
than &pound;100 a year, and then to authorize the Governors
to apply such part of the surplus of the Revenues, as
they shall think expedient, in the hiring one or more
assistant or assistants under such annual stipends as
they shall think proper for teaching different branches
of literature at the sd School; and the remainder of
the money to be by them applied in Exhibitions to
be given to any Scholar or Scholars of the sd School
going to either of the Universities, as the Governors
for the time being shall think best for the good of
the sd School, or in any gratuitys to be given to any<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_93" id="Page_93">[Pg 93]</a></span>
Scholar or Scholars to create emulation whilst at
School.</p>

<p>The Governors think it would be of great
use ... if some <span class="smcap">Annual Exhibition</span> were
established of 20 or &pound;30 a year to two or more Scholars
going to either of the Universities, who had resided
three of the last years of his Education as a Scholar
of Giggleswick School. Such Exhibitions to be held
for four years, if residing at the University, but they
have some doubt how far this can be done, or any
gratuity given to any Scholar to create Emulation,
whilst still at School, consistent with the Charter.
Therefore they desire Mr Withers to give his opinion.</p>

<p>.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.</p>

<p>As the present vicar of Giggleswick the Rev.
John Clapham was appointed in 1783 and in 1793
refused to act as Governor, has been a little obnoxious
to the rest of the Governors, they wish a Statute may
be prepared empowering any two of the Governors
from time to time to call a meeting of the Governors
respecting the sd School. And that any new elected
Governor may be sworn before any two Governors at
such meeting to be true and faithful towds the sd
School.</p>

<p>The whole of the Governors are perfectly unanimous
in this business, except the Rev. John Clapham, the
vicar, who has not attended lately the meetings of
the Governors, tho' he has always had regular notice
given him of every meeting that has been held, and
he gives no reason why he does not attend the meetings
and concur with the rest of the Governors in the
Trust.</p></div>

<p>Bishop Watson, of Llandaff, was also
consulted. He had already been connected
with William Paley, the Headmaster's son, and
had been his examiner for his degree, and
suggested the insertion of the "non," when
the Master of Christ's had been scandalized<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_94" id="Page_94">[Pg 94]</a></span>
by the subject on which Paley had intended to
write his theme.&mdash;"Aeternitas p&oelig;narum contradicit
divinis attributis." In the matter of the new
Statutes his friendly counsel had been sought
by John Parker, of Marshfield, Settle, one of
the Governing Body. The Bishop recommended
that twelve leaving Exhibitions should be
established of &pound;30 for four years, and the
remainder to be disposed of "at the discretion
of the Governors, to such young men as had
been distinguished by obtaining Academic or
Collegiate Honours during their residence in
the University." "Some appropriation of this
kind," he added, "if you take care to get a good
Master will make Giggleswick School one of the
first in the North of England, and I for one
prefer a School in the North and situated, as
Giggleswick is, out of the way of much
corruption, to either Eton or Westminster. As
to French and Mathematics being taught at a
great Classical School, I do not approve of it;
the Writing Master should make the scholars
quite perfect in common Arithmetic, and in
vulgar and decimal fractions, and that knowledge
will be a sufficient basis to build Mathematics
upon. Greek and Latin require so much time
and attention before they can be well understood,
that I think there is no time at School for any
other language."&mdash;Oct. 18, 1794.</p>

<p>Meanwhile the matter was developing. In<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_95" id="Page_95">[Pg 95]</a></span>
January, 1795, the Governors wrote direct to
Mr. Withers, and stated that they desired "<i>power
to borrow money for building an additional School</i>,"
or in the "<i>improvement of the Estates</i>." To this
Mr. Withers replied that he considered that
annual leaving Exhibitions came within the
province of the Governing Body, but they
could not borrow money without fresh legislation.
He further advised them to repeal all the old
Statutes.</p>

<p>The additional School buildings that they
proposed were a house for the Master. In
March, 1796, the Attorney-General gave his
opinion that the power to call meetings could not
be taken away from the Vicar, "if he remains
a corporate" or member of the Body, that the
granting of Exhibitions was <i>ultra vires</i>, and that
he doubted whether the provision for the Master
to teach Writing, Accounts, etc., "is consistent
with the Institution itself, doubting whether
the School founded is not a School for <i>teaching
Latin, etc.</i>," but possibly it might, he added, be
upheld, as a court would be hardly likely to
censure the Governors for applying a reasonable
sum to that purpose.</p>

<p>The Archbishop of York considered the
application, and altered it in one respect only.
He decided that it was too dangerous to pay
the Master a minimum of &pound;200 and the Usher
a minimum of &pound;100, for it would tend to make<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_96" id="Page_96">[Pg 96]</a></span>
them "independent of the Governors;" he
therefore preferred "to leave it in the breasts
of the Governors to reward them according to
their merit," but he allowed a minimum to be
inserted in each case, for the Master &pound;100, for
the Usher &pound;50. A Writing Master was also
to be appointed, and such other Assistants
"when occasion shall in their judgment require
to teach Writing, Accounts, Mathematics, and
different branches of Literature in the said
School." Their stipend was not fixed, and for
this reason. Mr. Saul had been acting as Writing
Master since 1784, at the salary of &pound;20 a year.
He left in 1790 and was succeeded by Mr.
Stannicliffe, who was paid at the same rate.
After six months he determined that the salary
was not satisfactory and sent in his resignation.
The Governors endeavoured to engage a
successor, but "finding they could not get a
proper person in his room for less than &pound;30 for
six months, they all agreed (except the Vicar) to
give that sum, and a Master has been employed
in the School upon these terms ever since."</p>

<p>In spite of their difficulty in getting a
"proper" person, there was no lack of
applicants, and one in particular is worthy of
reproduction:</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p style="text-align:right;">Littleboro', near Rochdale, Lancashire,</p>
<p style="text-align:right;padding-right:3em;">3rd April, 1792.</p>

<p>Revd. Sir,</p>

<p>Having perused your Advertisement in Wright's
Paper for a Writing-Master and Accountant for the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_97" id="Page_97">[Pg 97]</a></span>
free Grammar School at Giggleswick in your neighbourhood,
I take this Opportunity of offering myself
as a Candidate for that Office....</p>

<p>The Salary is but small but from the Tenor of
your Advertisement, I am inclined to believe that from
my assiduity and care, I should soon be able to
increase it.</p>

<p>I have studied the French and Italian Languages
grammatically and have travelled thro' many Parts of
Italy, France and Spain, after 4 years Residence in a
Counting House at Leghorn&mdash;I will thank you, Revd.
Sir, if you will candidly inform me pr Return of Post,
whether these two Languages will be useful in your
Part and how far Giggleswick is from Settle; also for
a particular description of the Place.&mdash;For if it be
populous, my Wife will carry on her Business, which
is that of Mantua making.</p>

<p>I have been twice at Settle, but it is a long time
ago. I was private Pupil to the Rev. Mr Shuttleworth
B.A., Curate of our Village, upwards of 12 years and
from him and from the neighbouring Gentlemen and
Clergy, I can obtain the needful; provided you think
it wd answer for me to come over with my Family and
settle.</p>

<p>I should like a neat House, with a good garden to
it and Accommodations for a few boarders.</p>

<p>Most Elections, in different Departments of Life,
are very unfair and partial and if you suppose this is
likely to be the case on the present Occasion, your
Candour will infinitely oblige me and be instrumental
in preventing my further trouble.</p>

<p>Your friendly reply as soon as possible will be
deem'd a great favour conferr'd on</p>

<p style="margin-left:35%">revd. Sir,</p>
<p style="margin-left:40%">Yr mo obedt Sert,</p>
<p style="margin-left:50%"><span class="smcap">John Woolfenden</span>.</p>
</div>

<p>He was not selected.</p>

<p>All candidates, or nearly all, sent with their
letters of application beautifully written testi<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_98" id="Page_98">[Pg 98]</a></span>monials
in different styles to shew their
proficiency, one unfortunately made a bad blot.
They were also put through an examination in
Arithmetic, when they assembled on the day of
election. One confessed to being a member
"of ye old Established Church," another "hoped
to continue so." Finally, Robert Kidd was
chosen. His letter of application is particularly
interesting, both because of its beauty and
because he says: "I have a good circuit for
half-a-year, and if attendance from January to
middle of the year, or from Midsummer to
January will suit at Giggleswick," he would be
ready to come. From this he appears to have
been one of the old type of Scrivener, who paid
regular visits to different Schools, and for whom
the Ancient Statutes of 1592 allowed a special
vacation to the Scholars. He wrote on April 8,
from Whalley Grammar School, and a special
messenger was sent to fetch him at a cost of 5<i>s.</i>
In the following year he wrote an elaborate
address to the Governors, in which he said,
"Permit me to say, I have been a faithful
labourer and Disciplinarian in your School. You
are truly sensible of the Inequality of the
Attendance and Salaries. Now Gentlemen, if
it be consistent with your Approbation, and the
Institution of your Seminary, to make a small
adjustment, the Favor shall be gratefully
acknowledged." He was accordingly "put to<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_99" id="Page_99">[Pg 99]</a></span>
the trouble of Keeping Accounts, etc., for the
Governors," and paid an additional two guineas
a year.</p>

<p>Archbishop Markham agreed to the alteration
of the Statutes with regard to the Governors
themselves, and thenceforward a newly elected
Governor was to protest and swear to be faithful
etc., in the presence of any two Governors,
instead of before the Vicar as formerly; and the
privilege of summoning meetings was taken
away from the Vicar and given to any two
Governors. Further, any five, duly assembled,
had the power to act and proceed with business,
and "the determination of the major part of
them shall be final and conclusive."</p>

<p>The Scholars moreover were at liberty to
receive annual rewards and gratuities, in such
manner as the Governors may deem "best
calculated to excite a laudable emulation." Thus
in 1798 three guineas were distributed among
them in the presence of the Masters and
Governors:</p>

<p>Any Scholar who had attended at the School<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_100" id="Page_100">[Pg 100]</a></span>
for the last three years of his education could
receive an Exhibition with which to attend any
English University, provided that the Governors
always reserved in their hands a sufficient sum
for the necessary Repairs of the School, and also
of a House for the habitation of the Master, if
and when such a House should be built.</p>

<p>Mr. Smith, who had been acting as Usher
but without a license from the Archbishop,
resigned in 1792 and Nicholas Wood succeeded
him. Possibly he had been educated at the School,
for in 1796 a letter was sent to the Archbishop
from the Governors saying that they had
appointed Nicholas Wood, of Giggleswick, Clerk,
to be Usher, and praying the Archbishop to
give him a license "subject to the said Statutes
and Ordinances," which had been agreed upon.</p>

<p>The new power to grant an increase of
salary was soon exercised and in 1797 the Headmaster
received &pound;250, the Usher &pound;100, "in
case of Diligence and good Conduct" and the
Assistant &pound;60 provided that he assisted the
Governors when necessary in "transacting the
business of their Trust" and taught Writing
and Arithmetic to the free School Scholars,
"every boy who has been at the free School
one month to be entitled." In the following
year Robert Kidd was allowed &pound;70 on condition
that he "gives due attention on every day in
the year, Saturdays, Sundays and one month<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_101" id="Page_101">[Pg 101]</a></span>
at Christmas only excepted and that, when
any boy is initiated into the ffree School
he will not take any pay in case such Boy or
Boys should attend his School, altho' they may
not have been a month at the ffree School."</p>

<p>The matter of prizes is also taken up and
a certain sum, which is not named, was allotted
to each of the three head classes and was to be
expended on books, which should be given to the
best Scholar of each class. No class was to compete
which had less than nine boys and they were
to be examined once every year in the presence
of the Governors.</p>

<p>The Master was required to see that the boys
in the higher department of the School had
their conversation during School hours in Latin.
This was evidently a throw-back to the Ancient
Statutes of 1592, when they were at least given
the alternative of Greek or Hebrew. Further
they said "conceiding that a Boy may improve
in writing as much by an exercise as a copy,
they recommend that every boy be obliged to
write his exercise in the high or Writing School,
under the inspection of the Writing Assistant
and each exercise to have his (<i>i.e.</i> the Assistant's)
initials affixed to signify that such Boy wrote
his best, not to signify whether a good or bad
Exercise."</p>

<p>It will be remembered that in the house that
James Carr built, the lower part was for advanced<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_102" id="Page_102">[Pg 102]</a></span>
teaching, the higher for writing. The distinction
had apparently continued and the upper portion
alone had materials for writing. Certain it is
that each portion was wholly distinct from the
other, and Usher and Assistant were masters
in their own domain. In June, 1797, the
Governors decided that attention should be paid
to Classics in the Writing Department and
Nicholas Wood, the Usher, was asked to undertake
the work but refused, whereupon Mr. Clayton
an Assistant in the Classical Work was requested
to do so and accepted the duty for an additional
remuneration of &pound;10.</p>

<p>These two men held an interesting position.
Wood certainly had a freehold, and Clayton was
difficult to remove, so that in 1798 the Governors
decided that an Assistant should "be provided
during the summer months to teach the Classical
Scholars, unless Mr. Wood and Mr. Clayton in
three days signifie that one of them will teach."
Fortunately Mr. Wood at once agreed to do so.
It referred, no doubt, to the Classical Scholars in
the Writing Department, whom Wood had refused
to instruct, but when Clayton undertook the
work and received &pound;10 for his trouble, Wood
relented.</p>

<p>Two months later the Governors issued a
pathetic appeal that the "Master's Assistant and
Usher be requested to attend better at the
School." It was July and only in the previous<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_103" id="Page_103">[Pg 103]</a></span>
April Robert Kidd's salary had been raised to
&pound;70 on stringent conditions of attendance.</p>

<p>The numbers of the School were growing
apace, for twice in 1798 it was resolved to advertise
for a Mathematical Assistant. At the same
meeting 25<i>s.</i> was allowed to the Master's Assistant
"for the purpose of providing fuel during the
winter and no collection shall be made from the
Scholars." The Staff seem to have been a little
difficult. Nicholas Wood refused to sign a
receipt in full for his wages when he was only
being paid a part, and the Governors resolved to
"withold the remainder of his salary."</p>

<p>Robert Kidd and Nicholas Wood left the
School in April, 1799, and John Carr, of Beverley,
took Kidd's place. Wood's post was filled by
Clayton, who was made Usher at a salary of &pound;100
a year, "provided he conducts himself to the
satisfaction of the Governors or a majority of
them," and agreed to teach five days a week.</p>

<p>Some difficulty arose, and on May 11 there
is a minute saying that "Mr. Wood and Mr.
Kidd had been settled with." Wood seems to
have been dependent on his wife, who could not
make up her mind whether she wished to stay
or go.</p>

<p>For the post of Usher there were
several applicants as well as Clayton, who got
testimonials from Magdalene College, Cambridge,
where he had behaved himself with "sobriety."<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_104" id="Page_104">[Pg 104]</a></span>
One of the applicants went so far as to give an
extract in Hebrew writing in order to shew his
capacity. The study of Hebrew in the School
had perhaps not lapsed. He further stated that
he did not consider it necessary to learn Latin
and Greek first, in order to get a good
knowledge of Hebrew. A sound foundation in
English was sufficient, though he hastened to
declare that he was perfectly capable of teaching
Latin and Greek "with quickness and accuracy."</p>

<p>An advertisement had before appeared with
a view to electing a Mathematical Assistant, and
was worded thus:</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>"Whereas the Revenue of the Free Grammar
School of King Edward the Sixth at Giggleswick is
very much increased. The Governors for that Charity
wishing to appropriate the same to be as useful to
the Community at Large as possible, have resolved
to appoint an <span class="smcap">Assistant</span> to teach Mathematics in
all its Branches, to commence the First Week of
February, 1799, provided there be Three Young Men
at that Time inclined to be instructed therein."</p>

<p>Therefore, <span class="smcap">Notice</span> is hereby given,</p>

<p>That Classics, Mathematics, Writing and Accompts,
etc., will be taught free of any Expense to any Person
in the Kingdom.</p>

<p>Such Persons as wish to be instructed in
Mathematics are desired to signify their Intention
by Letter addressed to the Governors of Giggleswick
School, on or before Michaelmas Day next, in order
that an Assistant may be obtained.</p></div>

<p>Certain School holidays were fixed at the
same meeting. They were to be the 12th and<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_105" id="Page_105">[Pg 105]</a></span>
13th of March (Potation Day and its successor),
Monday and Tuesday in Easter Week, Monday
and Tuesday in Whitsun-week, two days at
Laurence Mass (Lammas), one month at Christmas,
and "one month to commence the first
Monday after the 5th day of July annually."</p>

<p>But while the difficulties with the Usher
and the Assistants were developing, the attitude
of the Head Master was not altogether
satisfactory. In December, 1798, "Mr. Preston
reports that Rev. Mr. Paley refuses his
resignation upon such terms as the Governors
are inclined to receive ... therefore
resolved that the Recorder be applyed to for
every matter that the Governors are doubtful
about." William Paley was a man of
considerable age, and disinclined to believe
that he was unfit for his work. The Governors
had recognized the possibility that he would
not be strong enough for his duties, when in
1797 they had agreed to give him a salary of &pound;250
"for the time that School shall be taught by
him or by a sufficient and diligent Assistant."
Clayton probably acted as the Assistant. Yet
in December, 1798, the Governors' patience was
exhausted, for they had already questioned
Miss Elizabeth Paley on the subject, and she
appears to have given grounds for hoping that her
father would resign, but on the twenty-ninth he
definitely refused. They waited another nine<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_106" id="Page_106">[Pg 106]</a></span>
months, and on September 28, 1799, they
adjourned their meeting to October 5, "as
the present Master is not considered to survive
many days." On September 29 he lay dead.</p>

<p>For fifty-five years William Paley had
presided over the destinies of the School and
his work may fitly be compared with that of
his great predecessor Christopher Shute. Both
had taken up their work, when the fortunes of
the School were at a low ebb. Shute had
watched the careful saving of the School money,
until they had been able to purchase "the
school-house and yard in 1610 and a cart-road
in the same yard and liberty for the schollers to
resort to a certain spring to drink and wash
themselves 1619, and likewise a garden for the
use of the Masters and several other good
things." Paley had become Head Master in 1744
when no accounts were kept, when the Master
and Usher appropriated all the money from the
rents and when the boys were few in number.
Rapidly matters began to mend. His own son
William left the School in 1759 already a scholar
and destined to a lasting fame. Thomas Proctor
was a boy at the School between 1760 and
1770, and became a great sculptor. His
"Ixion" exhibited in 1785 is still recognized as
a work of genius. William Carr, of the same
family as James Carr, the founder of the School,
won a Scholarship at University College, Oxford<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_107" id="Page_107">[Pg 107]</a></span>
in 1782, a Fellowship at Magdalen 1787, and
settled down at Bolton Rectory in 1789. His
literary tastes brought him the friendship of
Wordsworth, and he became famous as the
breeder of a heifer of remarkable proportions.</p>

<p>One of Paley's pupils&mdash;Thomas Kidd&mdash;probably
a member of the same family as the
Writing Assistant, a family who had lived in the
neighbourhood certainly since 1587&mdash;wrote from
Trinity College, Cambridge, to the Vicar, the
Rev. John Clapham, in 1792:</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>Revd. Sir,</p>

<p>This appeals to the feelings: but we must attend to

<p>Trin. Coll., Camb., April 24&mdash;92.</p></div>

<p>The majority of those that went to
Cambridge seem to have gone to Colleges other
than Christ's, but of those who went there one,
Adam Wall, son "pharmacopolae haud indocti"
was Second Wrangler in 1746, and had a
distinguished Academic career, his own son
William was Senior Wrangler, John Preston
gained the "wooden spoon" in 1778, but was
afterwards elected a Fellow of his College, while
Thomas Paley his great nephew, was Third
Wrangler in 1798, and a Fellow of Magdalene.
All three were Christ's men. This was a very
good proportion of successes, seeing that only
thirteen boys went there from Giggleswick in
Paley's time.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_109" id="Page_109">[Pg 109]</a></span></p>

<p>Not only in the educational improvements,
but also in the financial increase of the School
property, these years were similar to the
beginning of the 17th century. North Cave
and Walling Fen were enclosed by Acts of
Parliament, and land worth &pound;140 in 1768 was
valued at &pound;750 in 1795. The Exhibition Fund
had no balance in 1765, while nine years later
there was &pound;100 in the bank. A new School
had been built, the teaching staff increased and
new Statutes made. Surely a great and enviable
Headmastership.</p>

<h3><a name="Chapter_VII" id="Chapter_VII"></a><span class="smcap">Chapter VII.</span></h3>

<h2>The Rev. Rowland Ingram, B.D.</h2>


<p><span class="dropcap">O</span>N the death of William Paley the Governors
at once began the task of finding a
successor. They inserted in the newspapers
an advertisement to the effect that a
vacancy had occurred and that candidates would be
examined by the Archbishop of York in Classics,
Mathematics, "or any other Branch of Literature,
his Grace may think proper." The salary was
to be from &pound;100&mdash;&pound;300 but no house was
provided.</p>

<p>There was a very strong field of applicants.
A Fellow of Trinity, Cambridge, Thomas Carr,
founder's kin&mdash;a Fellow of Hertford&mdash;a Fellow
of Queen's, Oxford&mdash;a Fellow of Sidney Sussex,
Cambridge&mdash;Headmasters of various Grammar
Schools, were all candidates. One Isaac Cook&mdash;Headmaster
of Ripon&mdash;explained as shewing the
high value of his Classical attainments that
when he was elected to Ripon he was examined
"with another candidate in Terence, Cicero,
Tacitus, the Greek Testament and Demosthenes,
and wrote a Latin Dissertation."</p>

<p>The Archbishop declined the honour of
examining the candidates, but later recommended
that they should appoint to the Mastership<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_111" id="Page_111">[Pg 111]</a></span>
his brother&mdash;John Sheepshanks&mdash;as one eminently
suitable. The Headmaster of Eton was then
asked to undertake the examination and was
offered "such pecuniary or other compliment"
as he might wish. As he did not even answer
their letter, they wrote to the Rev. W. Stevens,
Headmaster of Sedbergh, who undertook the duty.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 454px;">
<img src="images/image0111.jpg" width="454" height="578" alt="REV. ROWLAND INGRAM, M.A." title="" />
<span class="caption">REV. ROWLAND INGRAM, M.A.</span>
</div>

<p>In the result the Rev. Rowland Ingram
was elected. He had gained "one of the first
Mathematical honours" and had only just failed
to win the Bachelor of Arts Classical Medal. He
was a B.D. and a late Fellow and Tutor of Sidney
Sussex College, Cambridge. He was turned
thirty-two (his brother said he was thirty-four)
and after being for some years a private Tutor
at Eton had been appointed in Midsummer, 1798,
Headmaster of Ipswich Grammar School, where he
had made a considerable name. He was certainly
the strongest candidate who applied and it speaks
well for the Governors that they elected him,
notwithstanding the fact that two old Giggleswick
boys were standing&mdash;Thomas Carr and the Rev.
Thomas Paley, the former of whom had a very
distinguished academic career, and Paley had been
third Wrangler. Ingram began with a salary of
&pound;300 a year and within six months premises were
bought from Mr. Geo. Robinson, on which it
was determined to build him a house.</p>

<p>Troubles arose on the staff almost immediately.
John Carr who had succeeded Robert Kidd at<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_112" id="Page_112">[Pg 112]</a></span>
&pound;80 a year declared in June, 1800, that he would
not continue to teach under &pound;100. His request
was not complied with, but the Governors made a
compromise. They told him that he must give
reasonable notice before he left the School, but that
as his department consisted of a great number of
boys and it was impossible for him to pay
proper attention to them all, they had decided to
hire an Assistant. At the same time they
required that "teaching the English Grammar be
encouraged."</p>

<p>The recent and rapid growth of the Writing
Department is very significant. Its growth and
the importance laid upon it increased step by
step with the Industrial Revolution. It gave
an elementary education and was confined to
practical subjects&mdash;Arithmetic, Mensuration,
Merchants' Accounts, etc. Some confusion
existed in men's minds about the primary object
of a Grammar School. Giggleswick had not been
founded to give elementary instruction but its duty
was to impart a sound knowledge of the Classics, in
order to enable its pupils to go up to the University
with a Scholarship and thence enter one of the
learned professions and preferably become a Priest.
The boys were welcomed from whatever homes
they came, and though leaving Scholarships were
given with a preference to the poorer boy,
everyone received an education in the higher
branches of literature. Not until 1768 was<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_113" id="Page_113">[Pg 113]</a></span>
there any mention of the necessity of promoting
the study of elementary subjects. It is true that
the Statutes of 1592 had provided for a Scrivener
to teach writing but he was only to come for three
weeks in the year. In 1768 the Archbishop of
York desired that a more permanent teacher should
be chosen and the appointments of Saul, Stancliffe,
Kidd, which have already been noticed, and of
John Carr, of Beverley, were the result.</p>

<p>With the nineteenth century the School
rapidly developed in importance. Kidd had in
1798 been paid &pound;70 a year, Carr in the following
March received &pound;80 and clamoured for &pound;100. In
1801 owing to the increase of numbers the son
of Mrs. Mary Bradley acted as his Assistant for a
few months and later in the year Carr engaged
his own son, whom the Governors allowed to
remain, until a permanent Assistant was appointed.
The Governors passed and re-passed resolutions
on the question of providing a permanent teacher
and Mr. Clementson was appointed in 1805 and
taught the boys in a house built by the
Governors but lately used as a school by
Mr. Holmes. The proper School was possibly
growing too large and in 1804, the Archbishop
had suggested that English should be
taught in a distinct department. The teaching
of English grammatically was an innovation and
a natural response to the needs of the time.
Earlier ages had thought that in order to get a<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_114" id="Page_114">[Pg 114]</a></span>
thorough grasp of English it was first necessary
to pass through the portals of the Classics but
the get-educated-quick had no time for such
methods. Clementson was paid &pound;50 and, when
he demanded an increase, was graciously allowed
an additional &pound;20 "so long as his servitude shall
be agreeable to the parties."</p>

<p>For a brief period of seven weeks in 1806
William Stackhouse worked under Carr at the
rate of &pound;30&mdash;Clementson having left&mdash;and Carr
resigned in January, 1807. In that month he
received a last payment of &pound;5 5<i>s.</i>, as a reward
for examining candidates for the vacant post.
One of them, John Lockwood, was elected but he
was required to teach not only Writing and
Arithmetic but also Mathematics. He rejected the
offer and Stackhouse was appointed permanently
at &pound;100 a year. In 1809 he received &pound;150 and
continued at this salary till his death or
resignation in 1830.</p>

<p>In his appointment English, as a teaching
subject, was neglected, but later in the same
year the Archbishop was approached on the
propriety of establishing an English School
and in 1809 a minute of the Governors
declared that none were to be admitted into
the Writing School, unless they were able
to read and were under eighteen. This
points to an entire cleavage between the
Grammar and the Writing School. They were<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_115" id="Page_115">[Pg 115]</a></span>
in different parts of the building and a member
of the one was not of necessity a member of the
other. They were both subsisting on the same
foundation, but the Writing School was an
off-shoot, a child and an illegitimate one. Not
until the middle of the century did the old
School shake it off and return to the primary
objects of its foundation.</p>

<p>Obadiah Clayton, the Usher, began in June,
1800, to shew signs of insanity. The particular
form that it took was the habit of producing
pistols in School. He was put for a time in
an asylum and a Mr. Tomlinson was to be
written to as a successor, but as they did not
hear from the Archbishop to whom they had
applied for instructions, nothing was done.
Later Clayton returned from the asylum but
possibly for a time took no part in the School
work. In 1802 the Governors went to the expense
of 5<i>s.</i> 4<i>d.</i> in order to get advice on the propriety
of complying with his request that he should
attend a private pupil during school hours and
should be allowed to take the globes from the
School. His request was negatived.</p>

<p>Two years later, matters reached a head,
his conduct was not considered consistent
and the Archbishop suggested that they should
pay him the statutory minimum of &pound;50 and
hire an Assistant. The difficulty lay in the
fact that he held a freehold and could only<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_116" id="Page_116">[Pg 116]</a></span>
with great difficulty be made to resign.
Meanwhile, Carr and Ingram were requested
to report upon his conduct. Ingram declared
that Clayton's conversation was of a wild and
incoherent nature, but Carr was more minute. He
reported that Clayton did not attend the School
much for three weeks and that during that time
he appeared to be in a deranged state of mind
and made use of expressions such as that he
had got a letter from his wife in heaven, or that
the roads on which he walked were paved with
fire. Although the immediate cause of his
mental derangement was the death of his wife,
he had never enjoyed good health. One of his
testimonials from the Tutor of Magdalene
College, Cambridge, had said that he had been
compelled to leave Magdalene temporarily owing
to ill health. He continued however to teach
until 1805, when at his own suggestion he was
allowed to absent himself for four years without
giving up his license and he received &pound;50 a year.
This permission was characterized by the Archbishop
as an act of humanity, but the legality of
thus disposing of the Trust money was seriously
questioned. A year later the Governors received a
letter from him, saying that he had had many
difficulties and had visited many parts of England
but his "<i>dernier resort</i>" was at Bognor Barracks
where he had enlisted as a private soldier and was
anxious to be bought out. Some neighbouring<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_117" id="Page_117">[Pg 117]</a></span>
clergy had interested themselves in his case and
the Bishop of Chichester was willing to provide him
with a curacy, provided that satisfactory answers
came from the Governors of Giggleswick. Clayton
begged them therefore to say that the cause of
his leaving the School had been "ill-health."
He was released from the Army but probably
did not serve any curacy, for in May, 1808, he
was acting as a Chaplain in the Royal Navy,
after which nothing more is known of him
though he continued to be paid his salary till 1810.
His position as Usher was filled in that year by
John Armstrong, who had been elected as a
Classical Assistant in 1806; the Governors at
that time had proposed to offer &pound;50 as a fit
salary, but as no candidate had appeared on the
day of election, it was raised to &pound;100.</p>

<p>Ingram was an energetic man at the
beginning of his Headmastership and supported
by an able Governing Body and a growing
revenue, he had wished to enlarge the numbers of
the School and to increase its efficiency. Advertisements
had been put in the Leeds, London,
and Liverpool papers "for the encouragement of
the School," money had been annually distributed
among the Scholars to create emulation, the
English Department had been strengthened and
it had been decided to teach English grammatically.
Books had been bought more lavishly than
ever before, and also globes celestial and terrestrial,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_118" id="Page_118">[Pg 118]</a></span>
as they were "considered to be of great use in
every department of the School."</p>

<p>The numbers of the School increased
sometimes to such an extent that four masters
had to be engaged but this was never more
than a temporary expedient. The Charity
Commissioners issued a report in 1825 dealing
with the School, in which they gave the numbers
of the School as sixty-three, of whom twenty-three
were taught by the Master and forty by
the Usher. It gave no record of the number
in the English Department. These boys had a
feeling of distinct hostility against the Grammar
School boys. They were of a less wealthy class,
they lived in the neighbourhood and they were
receiving the priceless boon of a practical and
elementary education. The Grammar School
boys on the other hand were not all natives of
the place. About twenty-one came from the
Parish, ten were members of families who had
come to reside there, and the rest were wholly
strangers. They were compelled to learn Writing
and Mathematics, which they did not consider
liberal sciences, and they had to use the same
door of entrance and exit as their enemies.
This hostility developed into open strife and
partly accounts for the continual glazing bills that
the Governors had to meet. From 1783-1792 they
had been fairly constant amounting to about a
pound a year, but in 1803 5<i>s.</i> reward was offered to<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_119" id="Page_119">[Pg 119]</a></span>
anyone giving information about persons breaking
School windows, and in 1834 the bill was over
&pound;7. It was a very difficult position. The
Report of 1825 recommended that the elementary
education should be continued but if possible in
another building because it supplied a certain
need and, if discontinued, would arouse an even
greater hostility in the locality. At the same
time it distinctly recognized that such endowment
was probably illegal.</p>

<p>It has already been noticed that the revenues
of the School were expanding. In 1802 the
Governors received over &pound;800 from the North Cave
Estate, which five years later was valued at &pound;1,287
but was not let at this valuation. At the time
of the Report of 1825 the rental was considered to
be about &pound;1,140. The Exhibition Fund had
also risen from &pound;26 in 1801 to &pound;37 15<i>s.</i> in 1821,
and twice it reached &pound;40. The money at this
period was given as a rule to one person for
four years and at the end of that period as
re-assigned. There was no examination, the
boy or his father applied to the Governors and
the claimant could receive it, even if he had
already been three years resident in the University.
The increased income had been obtained by
the purchase of Government Stock. Between
1810 and 1814 Navy five per cents. were
bought to the extent of &pound;1,190, and in addition to
this the Governors had paid off the debt of<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_120" id="Page_120">[Pg 120]</a></span>
&pound;1,120, which had been incurred owing to the
enclosure of Walling Fen. They were paying
Ingram &pound;510 a year, John Howson, M.A., who
had been a former pupil of Paley and had
become Usher on John Armstrong's death in
1814, received &pound;205; and William Stackhouse
&pound;150. They had built a house for the Headmaster
and had repaired one for the Usher.</p>

<p>All boys were admitted into the School
for whom there was room, but they now had
to bring a certificate of good character for
the previous year. The boarders lodged with
the Usher and with people in the neighbourhood,
notably one John King and Mrs.
Craggs. These boys paid boarding fees.
When the Governors issued an advertisement
for a Writing Master in 1792 they gave the
salary as &pound;30 but "as much more can be made
by quarterage." Is it possible that quarterage
can mean taking boarders? It is not certain
whether Ingram took boarders, but he probably
did. His house was built gradually.
Although the land was bought in 1800, the
mode of a building for Master, Usher and
Assistant was still being discussed in 1802.
In October of the same year John Nicholson
was commissioned to erect it at a cost of &pound;700.
It was finished in 1804, and Nicholson undertook
to repair a house for the accommodation
of the Usher or Assistant at a cost of &pound;250.</p>

<p>Carr, the Writing Master, was complaining
bitterly of the "numberless inconveniences" he
had suffered, and in January, 1805, was looking
forward to living at last in a good house,
though he was not quite sure whether he would
"live to enjoy it." But by March he had not
got into it and working himself up into a fit
state of indignation delivered himself of the
following letter to Thomas Paley, one of the
Governors:</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>Sir,</p>

<p>I am very poorly with a cold I have taken by
lying in a damp bed, I thought last night I must
have called somebody to my assistance, I have with
difficulty got thro' the fatigues of the day.</p>

<p>Surely when Nicholson undertook the house, he
had not permission to defer the completing of it
<i>ad libitum</i>. It was first thought it would have been
done six weeks before Christmas. Mr. N. has now
converted the house into a workshop for the
convenience of his people to carry on the repairs
that are to be done to the dog-kennel: in order to
make it habitable for some of Mr. Armistead's people:
and the plasterer has also been absent for the last
two days, I suppose, employed by Mr. N. at Astick.
If I had any tolerable convenience it would be quite
another thing; but I have never had a comfortable
place to lie down in since I have been at Giggleswick,
tho' I have been a slave to the business of the School,
and stood much in need of undisturbed and comfortable
rest. I am indeed sorry to trouble you so often, but
not only my happiness, but my life is at stake: and I
would rather leave Giggleswick immediately than go
on so any longer.</p></div>

<p style="margin-left: 30%;">I remain, Sir,</p>
<p style="margin-left: 40%;">Yours etc.,</p>
<p style="margin-left: 50%;"><span class="smcap">J. Carr</span>.</p>
<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_122" id="Page_122">[Pg 122]</a></span></p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>Monday, <span class="smaller">P.M.</span></p>

<p>P.S.&mdash;Mr. Ingram could have done a little longer
without a scullery, as well as I can do (if I
ever go to it) without a garden wall and a
necessary.</p></div>

<p>He did not stay many years longer but
resigned in 1807. Ingram's house was known as
Craven Bank and in 1829 he added a stable at
the cost of &pound;60. Howson also was having money
spent upon his house. In 1817 he had a
new kitchen built at the cost of &pound;100 and
seven years later he received &pound;120 to repair his
house, while his salary had already been increased
&pound;5 yearly to meet the cost of alterations and repairs.</p>

<p>The closing years of Rowland Ingram's
time were not bearing the fruit that the first
decade had promised. But the School turned
out at least one good Scholar&mdash;John Saul
Howson&mdash;a son of the Usher. Born in 1816
he went up to Trinity College, Cambridge, in
1833, at the age of seventeen. He won a
Scholarship there and also received money from
the Tennant Exhibition Fund. He took some
University prizes, and a first class in both
Classics and Mathematics. As Head of Liverpool
College for ten years he did a great educational
work, by releasing it from debt and reforming its
system. Later he was appointed Dean of
Chester where eventually he died. As a
Churchman he was a notable figure and as a
Christian he will be remembered long.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_123" id="Page_123">[Pg 123]</a></span></p>

<p>On the whole the teaching in later years
was not efficient. J. S. Howson relates how
before he was eight years old he had said
the Latin Grammar through four times
without understanding a word of it. This was
a remarkable achievement but not adequate
evidence of supreme genius in the teacher.
Education, like most other things, was everywhere
at its nadir, and Giggleswick was no
exception. In the whole of Ingram's time as
Headmaster&mdash;43 years&mdash;he had three Ushers.
One was mad, one died after four years, and
one&mdash;John Howson&mdash;grew grey-headed with the
work. He had during the same period three
Writing Masters, of whom one was most
cantankerous, another stayed twenty-four years,
and the third&mdash;John Langhorne&mdash;was not wholly
a success. He managed the School Accounts
from 1839-1845, but they were found to be "so
inaccurate and confused" that Mr. Robinson
had to enter them in the book afresh.</p>

<p>The constancy of a staff which from 1814-1831
never varied, and of whom two were local
men, contributed to the depression of the School.
Another contributory cause lay in the constitution
of the Governing Body. During the last decade
of the eighteenth century and the first decade
of the next the Governors showed themselves
very diligent in the pursuit of the School's
welfare. But as time went on, the increasing<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_124" id="Page_124">[Pg 124]</a></span>
revenues created an increasing thirst for more.
The Accounts dealt less and less with things
appertaining to the School, more and more with
the management of the North Cave Estate.
Between the years 1810 and 1843 there were not
more than two meetings of the Governors,
the minutes of which refer to the conduct
of the School; instead they refer constantly to
the growing balance in the Bank (in 1817 it
was over &pound;1,500) and they dissipated it by
gratuities equivalent to half a year's salary to
the several Masters and in profuse expenditure
in building and repairs. There was but one
man among them who had known the days
when &pound;350 was all they had a year, and
only a tumbledown school to teach in. John
Clapham must have looked back with mixed
feelings as he regarded the energy, the efficiency,
and the swelling numbers of that early part of
the century and compared them with later
years.</p>

<p>There was one more change of importance
in this time. The Potation was still retained and
the cost of the meetings on March 12 grew more
and more. The Governors came to dine
but they remained to sup. In 1784 fifteen
sat down to a dinner, costing 1<i>s.</i> a head, they
had eight bottles of Wine, 12<i>s.</i> 6<i>d.</i> worth of
Punch, and Ale 4<i>s.</i> 6<i>d.</i> In 1802 ten had dinner
at 2<i>s.</i> 6<i>d.</i> a head, nine had supper. They drank<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_125" id="Page_125">[Pg 125]</a></span>
fourteen bottles of Wine, on Rum and Brandy
they spent 15<i>s.</i> 6<i>d.</i>, and on Ale 4<i>s.</i> 6<i>d.</i> Similar
meetings took place each year. There was also
a change in the boys' share. They probably&mdash;there
is not always a record&mdash;had Figs and
Bread given them every year but, sometimes
Ale was also provided. In 1802 they had
5<i>s.</i> 6<i>d.</i> worth, and in 1807 they had some
but it cannot be asserted that they always had
it and between 1807 and 1825 the practice
completely dropped and has never been revived.</p>

<p>Rowland Ingram&mdash;old Rowland, as the boys
called him&mdash;was growing old, and in 1844 he
retired on a pension. His friends and neighbours
determined to give him some substantial
recognition of the esteem with which they
regarded him, and in January, 1845, a committee
was formed to decide its nature. In the end
a Portrait was painted, and the surplus was
placed in the hands of the Governors, to be
expended on the foundation of a library, to be
attached to the School, or in any other substantial
way, such as would seem to them more likely
to be permanently beneficial to the School.</p>

<h2>The Rev. George Ash Butterton, D.D.</h2>

<h2>1845-1858.</h2>


<p><span class="dropcap">I</span>N 1834 the Governors felt some doubt
respecting the legality of the last Statutes of
1795 and proposed to bring forward some
Scheme to obtain sufficient power for the management
of the School. Thereafter for six years the
Minute-Books were completely silent on this
matter, but in 1840 they noted that the number of
boys in the High School learning Writing and
Arithmetic under Langhorne was greater than
one man could efficiently attend to. The
Headmaster was therefore requested to propose
regulations such as he might think expedient for
making the High School more useful, as
subsidiary to the Grammar School, either by
insisting upon qualifications in the Scholars
previous to admission, limiting the number to
be admitted or otherwise, and to submit such
regulations for the consideration of the Governors.
Presumably some steps were taken, but the
Governors were beginning to feel that all was not
right, and in 1843 they became more definite.
They decided first, "That from the change of
Times and other causes, the Education afforded
at the Giggleswick Grammar School is at the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_127" id="Page_127">[Pg 127]</a></span>
present time insufficient for general purposes,
and more especially for the purposes of Trade
and Mercantile Business."</p>

</div>

<p>It will be as well to pause here and remark
this very notable statement. Reformers had
been at work before, but their effect had been
very slight. They had succeeded in establishing
a Writing Master, whose duty it was to
give free elementary instruction. Now, forty
years later, dissatisfaction was surging in the
breasts of the Governors, because the elementary
instruction was too elementary, and because its
spirit did not pervade the whole School. Now for
the first time was it laid down that the business of
a School was to train its children so as to fit them
in some obvious manner for the work of their
life. Latin and Greek and Hebrew had become
the touchstone of education, primarily because
they were the "holy" languages, and after
Religion had long ceased to be the mainspring of
education, their intrinsic merits fell into the background.
Utility became a more pungent argument.
Secondly, the Governors decided that the
Endowment and Statutes, together with the
particulars of the income of the School, should
be laid before a competent Chancery Barrister
who should suggest a system of education upon
a more extended scale.</p>

<p>The necessity for some alteration in the
Statutes was established by the refusal of the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_128" id="Page_128">[Pg 128]</a></span>
Governors in 1844 to accede to Mr. Ingram's
desire for a new Assistant. They declared that
such an arrangement was not contemplated by the
Charter and Statutes and therefore could not be
made. An impossible situation had arisen, and
the Statutes must be revised. But there was
one difficulty. A new Scheme could not be
carried out except on the appointment of a
new Headmaster or with his willing consent.
Ingram was approached upon the subject and
declared his readiness to retire on a pension of
&pound;300 a year, and with permission to continue
to occupy his official residence, Craven Bank.
He was seventy-eight years old, and in
view of his long service to the School, his
request could scarcely be denied. Four years
later he died, and like his predecessor, William
Paley, was buried in Giggleswick Church,
amidst a great gathering of men who came
to bear tribute to "his truly Christian
character."</p>

<p>His resignation had paved the way for a
new Scheme, in accordance with the Act passed
in 1841, for "improving the condition and
extending the benefits of Grammar Schools."
The Scheme was drawn up by the Governors,
commented on by Arthur Lynch, Master in
Chancery, 1844, and in the next year confirmed
by the Vice-Chancellor of England. It will be
well to examine the Report in some detail. In<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_129" id="Page_129">[Pg 129]</a></span>
the first place the Bishop of Ripon was in all
cases substituted for the Archbishop of York,
where the latter had jurisdiction. Secondly,
the 1795 Statutes were wholly omitted and of
the earlier Ordinances of 1592, only such were
retained as were in tune with the spirit of
the age.</p>

<p>New regulations were also added. The Headmaster
must be a Clergyman of the Church of
England, and a Master of Arts. He must be a good
Classical Scholar and a Mathematician, thoroughly
capable of teaching both subjects, and qualified
to teach Logic, Rhetoric, English in all its
branches, and Moral and Political Philosophy.
The requirements in an Usher were less
exceptional. He must be a member of the
Church of England, but need not be in Orders.
He should be capable of taking the higher
Classical Forms occasionally, be skilled in English,
and rather less advanced Mathematics, and have
an elementary knowledge of Modern Science.
He was to be appointed by the Governors.</p>

<p>The salary of the Headmaster was to be a
minimum payment of &pound;210 and a maximum
of &pound;360, with a house; the Usher was to
receive a house and &pound;150 and a capitation fee
of &pound;2, which was so limited that it was only
possible to rise to &pound;210. Each could receive ten
boarders. Other Assistants might be employed,
but their united salaries were not to exceed &pound;230.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_130" id="Page_130">[Pg 130]</a></span>
The retiring age was fixed at sixty-five, when the
Master and Usher would be granted a pension,
but the Governors could extend the services of
either beyond the age limit, if they so willed.
The surplus funds were to be used in such
a way as to make the Exhibition money from
the Burton Rents, etc., up to &pound;70 a year. The
Bishop of Ripon was to appoint an Examiner
every Christmas, and receive a Report from
him. Holidays were fixed for a month in the
Summer and at Christmas, three days each at
Easter and Whitsuntide, in addition to the
Saturday and Sunday and Good-Friday. Every
Saturday and the day of riding the Parish
boundaries were to be whole holidays.</p>

<p>Further, the arrangements by which one
Master relieved another in case of illness or
absence, the place where each Master should sit
in School, the disposition of the School into
Forms and Classes, the amount of time to be
devoted to each branch of instruction&mdash;provided
always that every boy should learn some Latin
and Greek&mdash;all these questions of internal
arrangement, which were essentially within the
province of the Headmaster, were to be agreed
upon by the Governors and reduced to writing.</p>

<p>It is almost inconceivable that such a
scheme was ever put on paper, yet it lived for
twenty years. The Headmaster was bound and
shackled beyond belief. He could not appoint<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_131" id="Page_131">[Pg 131]</a></span>
or dismiss his Masters, he had no power to
admit boys into the School, nor, unless they
were "altogether negligent and incapable of
learning," could he remove them. He was powerless.
Ingram had retired in 1844, and the scheme
then had gone forward and been completed before
a new Headmaster was appointed. Thus the
details of the management of the School were
settled, quite irrespective of the point of view
of the man who was to be responsible.</p>

<p>In August, 1845, the Governing Body&mdash;eight
discreet men&mdash;met to appoint Ingram's
successor. There was, as in 1800, a strong list
of applicants, but the choice fell unanimously
on the Rev. George Ash Butterton, D.D., late
Fellow of S. John's College, Cambridge, and at
the time Headmaster of Uppingham School. As
a boy he had been fortunate enough to have
been one of Kennedy's Sixth Form pupils at
Shrewsbury School, and his subsequent success
at Cambridge shewed that he was among the
ablest Scholars of his year.</p>

<p>The first three years passed uneventfully.
Small alterations were made in the School, and
with the aid of &pound;150 from the Governors, he
added a wing to his house at Craven Bank. In
1849 he desired the Governors, in accordance
with the scheme, to appoint a Master for teaching
Modern Languages, but they were unwilling
to do this "until such addition shall have been<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_132" id="Page_132">[Pg 132]</a></span>
made to the School, as will afford suitable
accommodation for such a Master and his class."
This is the first intimation that the Governors
were considering the question of building.
Complaints had been made before that numbers
were increasing and exceeding the limits of the
room or the staff, but nothing had been done.
Now, however, the question was actively
taken up.</p>

<p>The immediate resolve was to build an
addition of a Library and a Class-room for
Modern Languages, and further to raise the
School-rooms and give them better light and
ventilation. Many Subscriptions were offered
by the Masters, Old Pupils, and other friends
of the School, towards a more ornamental style
of building than the School funds could afford.
The Architects' plans grew, and it was soon
found that very little of the old structure
would remain. Consequently in 1850 it was
decided to build the School afresh from its
foundations.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 658px;">
<img src="images/image0132.jpg" width="658" height="458" alt="THE OLD SCHOOL." title="" />
<span class="caption">THE OLD SCHOOL.</span>
</div>

<p>Finance troubled the Governors much, for
they did not feel justified in spending more Trust
money than was essential for the upkeep of the
School. The Library and the new Class-room
were essential, and the Governors were prepared
to find the money for them, but the rest they
hoped to receive from outside help. They put
forward a statement of the need, and the resulting<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_133" id="Page_133">[Pg 133]</a></span>
subscriptions were very satisfactory. Two Old
Boys and sons of the Usher, the Rev. John Saul
Howson and his brother George Howson,
undertook the entire expense of the Ornamental
Doorway. The relatives of the Rev. John
Carr, Professor of Mathematics in the University
of Durham, put in a long window immediately
above the doorway. In this window is a
representation of John Carr, the Headmaster up to
1744. Further, &pound;50 remained over from the
Ingram Testimonial Fund, and was now to be
applied to the decorating of a window in the
Library with stained glass.</p>

<p>The building was substantial and sound.
The main part consisted of two long Class-rooms,
one on the ground floor, one above. These
both ran the whole length of the building,
until the Library was reached which with the
Modern Language Room formed a transverse
addition. A stone staircase, winding and
unexpectedly long, ascended from the main
entrance, and at its top was the High or Writing
School. In the Class-room below were two
platforms, now disappeared, the one by the door
for the Usher's desk, the one by the Library for
the Master. The Modern Language Room opened
into it. There were two doors, one the main
entrance chiefly used by the boys, the other
smaller and undistinguished for the Masters
only. It led into the Library and into a Tower,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_134" id="Page_134">[Pg 134]</a></span>
where the School bell was. The Library was
not very big but a long narrow room, and inset
in the wall was a fire-proof safe, for the better
preservation of the Charter and other documents.
It alone has continued to serve its original purpose.
It is not possible to judge accurately the
difference in size between this building and
its predecessor, but it was distinctly bigger. The
poplars which are to be seen in the photograph
of the Drawing of the 1790 School were felled
for the new one and the School filled the space.
In addition there was a cloister-like building
at the back, where in hours of play refuge
might be sought from the weather.</p>

<p>The total cost was over &pound;2,000, or more
than seven times as much as its predecessor.
Much of the money came from subscriptions,
some from the surplus income of the School,
but the rest was obtained by selling out
&pound;645 7<i>s.</i> 2<i>d.</i> New 3&frac14; per cent. Stock belonging to
the Exhibition Fund. The Governors pledged
themselves to pay 3&frac12; per cent. to the Exhibition
Fund, thus depleted, and to repay the principal
out of surplus income at the rate of 10 per
cent. per annum, or more, if convenient. It
was represented that this would at once
be an advantage to the Exhibition Fund
and also an economical method of borrowing
the necessary money. The money was repaid
by 1855.</p>

</div>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_135" id="Page_135">[Pg 135]</a></span></p>

<p>The cost of the Ornamented Doorway, paid
for by the Usher's two sons, was estimated at
&pound;48 13<i>s.</i>, but this was exclusive of the Niche and
the Statue of Edward VI which it contained.
This Statue was an object of the frequent missile
and was so often cast down that it was at last
removed. On the outside of the Library Wall is
a Coat of Arms belonging to the Nowell family
and underneath is the extract from the Charter
"<i>Mediante Johanne Nowell</i>." One relic of James
Carr's School remained, the stone slab with
its Hexameter inscription, and as it had found
a place inset in the wall of the second building,
so it did in 1850, but after a time it was removed
owing to its decay.</p>

<p>The first Speech Day in the new School
was celebrated in a fitting manner on March
12th, 1851. Three prize Odes were composed
on the subject of re-building and were read
by their respective authors. F. Howson recited
some rapt verses, extolling Queen Victoria and
telling her that the New School should stand
as her memorial.</p>

<p>The School might reasonably be expected
to go forward quickly, with new buildings, a new
Headmaster and strenuous Governors, and in
1850 they received a just recognition of the quality
of the teaching. The Provost and Fellows of
of Queen's College, Oxford, had a very large
sum of money at their disposal, which was
devised to them by Lady Elizabeth Hastings.
She had intended the money to be divided
annually among boys from schools in the
North of England. The privilege of being
one of the schools able to send boys in for
the Exhibitions&mdash;which were very valuable&mdash;was
offered to Giggleswick and gratefully
accepted. The Exhibitions have frequently
been won.</p>

<p>The first Examination under the new
scheme was held in December, 1862. The
Bishop of Ripon appointed the Rev. William
Boyd, M.A., Examiner. He found the School
in "an efficient working condition," in both the
higher and lower departments. The first class,
which in those days consisted of the senior boys,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_138" id="Page_138">[Pg 138]</a></span>
passed a good Examination in Greek Testament,
a play of Aeschylus, Homer, Thucydides, Horace,
and Vergil, Geography and Ancient History.
The Latin Prose Composition of two or three
was very good.</p>

<p>The Second Class were examined in Homer,
Xenophon, Ovid, and C&aelig;sar. Books were given
as prizes to the value of &pound;13 4<i>s.</i> Both in
this Examination and in the two succeeding
years the proficiency of the first form was
very marked, and the general efficiency of the
teaching was commented on. The most
general excellence lay in Divinity, but as the
subject was a limited one <i>e.g.</i> Life of Abraham,
and the work for it began six months
before, perhaps too much stress should not be
laid on it. There were seven classes, all of
them doing Latin, with the fourth class doing
Eutropius, and they were also examined in
Modern Geography, the History of England,
and the Catechism.</p>

<p>In 1844, four old boys, William Garforth,
John Saul Howson, John Birkbeck, and William
Robinson agreed together to contribute to a
fund for the provision of two prizes each half
year. They were to be called, "The Giggleswick
Pupils' Prizes," and were to consist of Books,
stamped with the School Seal. One was to be
given to the boys of the Upper part of the
School for the best English or Latin Essay,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_139" id="Page_139">[Pg 139]</a></span>
and the other to the Lower boys for General
Merit.</p>

<p>In 1853, the Howson Prizes were given by
the Fellows of Christ's College, Cambridge, and
other friends, in memory of George Howson,
a son of the Usher, and himself a Fellow of his
College. It was a striking testimony to the
character of the man that his associates should
thus wish to "perpetuate the name of our highly
gifted and lamented friend." They wished in
some small degree to advance "the interests of
an institution, which was, we know, most dear
to him, from early associations, and also from
his worthy father's long and honourable
association with it." They asked that two
prizes should be given annually to the boys
of the Lower School, one for General Proficiency,
regard being had to conduct, and one for the
best examination in a defined portion of Scripture
History; the subject was to be announced at
least six months before.</p>

<p>The School had been re-built chiefly in
order to provide room for a Teacher of Modern
Languages, and in 1855 the Governors proposed
to appoint such an one. They laid down the
following regulations: He should attend five
days a week&mdash;all classes except the highest and
lowest should learn French, and the highest
might, if they wished. Italian, German and
Hebrew were to be optional with all. Lastly,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_140" id="Page_140">[Pg 140]</a></span>
all classes except the highest must attend the
English Master. The salary of the Modern
Language Master was to be &pound;130 a year.</p>

<p>The Masters were requested to draw up a
scheme of work. The hours of School had been
altered in 1844 and were now from 8-0 a.m.
till noon, and from 2-0 p.m. till 5-0 p.m. (in
the Winter till 4-30 p.m.). All the Masters
and Assistants were compelled to teach every
hour of every school day. The scheme is as
follows:<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_141" id="Page_141">[Pg 141]</a></span></p>

<p>N.B. The numbers 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, mark the different classes</p>

<p>The stragglers, not classified, are included under number 7.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_142" id="Page_142">[Pg 142]</a></span></p>

<p>Every class did Classics for at least two
hours every day, very often four. English had
no place in the Schedule for the first three
forms; yet by the scheme the second and third
had to attend the English Master. Arithmetic
was the only subject of a mathematical type. It
was only a scheme for the General Course of
Instruction and doubtless under the name of
Classics or of Mathematics, they may have found
some scope for English or Scripture. Scripture
was certainly done by the first and second but
possibly only in the Greek Testament.</p>

<p>The Examiner appointed by the Bishop of
Ripon in 1855 paid many tributes to the
excellence of the first class, and added "all of
whom bid fair to do honour to the School by
high University distinction." It is the nature
of some men to exude praise, but words such
as these certainly seem to point to a very fair
level of scholarship in the class taken by Dr.
Butterton and to considerable powers of teaching
on his part.</p>

<p>Dr. Butterton was destined to rule the
School for two more years, but they were filled
with such bitter fruit that it is difficult to
describe them. It will be remembered that the
Governors according to the new scheme held
themselves responsible for the election of boys
who wished to enter the School. At the
beginning of every term the Headmaster would<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_143" id="Page_143">[Pg 143]</a></span>
supply them with a list of boys, with the district
from which they came and, if there was room
for them, there seems to have been no hesitation
about admitting them. There was not even, as
far as appears, a question of a certificate of
character for those boys who wished to be
Boarders, though perhaps it was so customary
since Ingram's early years that it passes without
comment. Only once, in 1854, does the number
of applicants appear to have exceeded the
number of vacancies. Acting on the presumption
that such a selection or election was almost
a matter of form Dr. Butterton admitted certain
boys into the School on his own authority in
1856. He had clearly put himself in the wrong
and he was admonished by the Governors.</p>

<p>There was also at the same time a dispute
between him and the Governors, relative to the
appointment of the Modern Language Master.
There had been several applicants and one had
been chosen, but the Headmaster did not
consider the choice wholly an impartial one
and he was unwise enough to say so. The
Governors pointed out to him that the
appointment of the Masters was vested wholly
in the Governors and that it was most improper
for him to interfere. The Governors were
acting perfectly within their rights and in
accordance with the scheme. But the scheme
was totally unsound for the proper management<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_144" id="Page_144">[Pg 144]</a></span>
of a School. Again when Dr. Butterton wished
the Whitsuntide holidays to be added to the
month in the Summer, he was informed that
according to the scheme there must be holidays
at Whitsuntide and not more than a month in
the Summer, and so nothing could be done.</p>

<p>Perhaps as a man he was too impetuous
and slightly intolerant, and, though it would have
been difficult for the most godly of men to keep
a school alive and progressing under such conditions,
it was quite impossible for him to hope
to succeed, unless he kept the staff upon his side.
But he quarrelled with John Howson, the Usher,
on two distinct occasions, one on a question of
discipline and one with regard to a French
Class that he caused to be held during School
hours in his own house, by a man of his own
choice. On both occasions the immediate cause
of disagreement was but the final spark of a
smouldering and mutual discontent, and it is
impossible to distribute the blame.</p>

<p>The Modern Language Master was placed
upstairs in the High School and a space was
partitioned off for him from the main part of
the room, where Mr. Langhorne was giving
Elementary Instruction. Such an arrangement
was not entirely suitable and the French Classes
were afterwards taken in the room which had
been especially built for them next to the
Library.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_145" id="Page_145">[Pg 145]</a></span></p>

<p>The next months saw the gradual development
of a situation that caused Dr. Butterton's
retirement. The Rev. John Howson also showed
signs of so serious an illness that he expressed
his readiness to retire, should some suitable
arrangement be made. The Governors agreed
to give him a pension of &pound;120 a year.</p>

<p>Dr. Butterton's Headmastership cannot be
dismissed without a reference to certain customs
that were prevalent in his time. Down the
centre of the pathway that runs alongside the
School palings on to the main road there is a
black stone fixed in the ground. This was a
familiar place of torture. Every new boy was
taken thither and made to sit down heavily on
its top. It was a custom that continued for
some years, until the removal of the School
buildings to their present position took away
the temptation. The distribution of Figs and
Bread on March 12 still continued but
cock-fighting had gradually died out. It had
long been the custom to use the Figs as
missiles and the objects of attack were
Masters, Governors, spectators and even Ladies.
It is very difficult to say whether March
12, was ever a day on which the Masters
used to collect money gifts from the boys.
Potation Day was the customary day for such
offerings in many schools, but at Giggleswick
the practice of receiving money from the Scholars<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_146" id="Page_146">[Pg 146]</a></span>
was particularly forbidden in the case of the
Writing Master in 1799, and at other times.
And it may be that money was taken in a
more official way. Three guineas frequently
appears in the Minute-Book as the "contribution
of the Scholars" towards the firing and heating
of the School, and in 1852 blinds were provided
for the School windows, but the Minute-Book
expressly said that they were to be kept in
repair by the Boys.</p>

<p>There has already been occasion to notice
the very heavy glazier bills that the Governors
had to meet, and there is a fitting commentary
upon them in an extract from a letter to the
Governors written by the Rev. Dr. Butterton:</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>"I take the opportunity of mentioning a circumstance,
which requires the interference of the
magistrates or at any rate of the police. Every evening
all the rabble of Giggleswick and Settle assemble in
the Schoolyard and conduct themselves in such a
riotous manner, that no schoolboy dare enter the
yard and no lady dare pass through it. They play at
ball against the library wall to the imminent danger
of the windows, and frequently climb up to the top
of the building to the serious injury of the roof. As
the nuisance seems to increase every evening, it
appears to me that strong measures must be taken to
put it down."</p></div>

<p>This chapter cannot close without a brief
and inadequate account of the Rev. John Howson.
He was born at Giggleswick in 1787 and was
a pupil at the School during the later years of<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_147" id="Page_147">[Pg 147]</a></span>
William Paley's Headmastership; in 1798 his
name was in the list of pupils who received a
prize. He graduated B.A. and M.A. at Dublin,
and in March, 1814, he came back to his old
School as Second Master on John Armstrong's
death. He was ordained Priest and married a
daughter of Mr. J. Saul, who had been at one
time Writing Master at the School. He remained
at Giggleswick till his death. He was of a type
of schoolmaster, now extinct, hot tempered, but
kindly natured; one of his pupils is said to
have returned from the Colonies bent on one
thing, determined to have his revenge on
Howson for some act of supposed injustice done
to him as a boy. His portrait reveals a geniality
that marked him always, though at times he
was inclined to distrust new ideas and new men.
He preferred the well-trodden path.</p>

<p>The year before Dr. Butterton had been
appointed Headmaster had been marked by the
first appearance of a School Magazine, of which
record remains. The Giggleswick School Olio
ran to three numbers under the motto of Vade,
Vale, Cave. Its contributions are ambitious
and graceful, poetry haunts its pages, and is of
a kind that reflects considerable Classical reading.</p>

<p>Two boys under Dr. Butterton deserve
some mention. Jackson Mason, the son,
grandson, and father of Giggleswick boys,
recited a poem in honour of the re-building of the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_148" id="Page_148">[Pg 148]</a></span>
School in 1851, and after being a scholar of Trinity
College, Cambridge, became later Vicar of Settle.
Though an invalid, he made his mark as a
translator of many hymns from the old Latin,
and his work remains in the Ancient and Modern
Hymn-Book. J. H. Lupton was a Scholar of
St. John's College, Cambridge, and afterwards Fifth
Classic and Surmaster of S. Paul's School. These
are not isolated examples of the academic success
that attended Dr. Butterton's Headmastership.
The Speech Day of 1855 recorded not a few.
It was notable for being the first year a Giggleswick
boy&mdash;Bramley&mdash;had ever won the Lady
Elizabeth Hastings' Exhibition at Queen's College,
Oxford, and was marked by high distinctions
gained at Cambridge by three other former
boys, Lupton, Mason, and Leeming.</p>

<p>Under Dr. Butterton there is probably little
doubt that, with the exception of his last year,
the School had increased greatly in efficiency.
Its numbers averaged eighty-three and once
reached ninety-one. It had re-built itself and had
attracted the generosity of old boys and friends
in the endowment of prizes. The subjects of
instruction had been increased. The discipline,
had improved. Fresh blood had been wanted,
and a fresh scheme. They were both obtained.
But perhaps the scheme did not represent the
summit of human wisdom, perhaps the fresh
blood was too rich.</p>

<h3><a name="Chapter_IX" id="Chapter_IX"></a><span class="smcap">Chapter IX.</span></h3>

<h2>The Rev. J. R. Blakiston.</h2>


<p><span class="dropcap">T</span>HE resignation of Dr. Butterton did not in
any way modify the determination of
the Governors to hold by the existing
Scheme. A printed notice of the qualifications
required by the new Master and Usher was
sent out. The Master had to excel in all
branches of learning, the higher branches of
Greek and Latin Literature, advanced Mathematics,
Logic, Rhetoric, English of all kinds
and Moral and Political Philosophy. The
qualifications of the Usher were less exacting.
Salaries at a minimum of &pound;210 and &pound;150 were
offered, and for every additional boy in the
School after the first thirty and up to sixty,
the Master received &pound;5, the Usher &pound;2 as a
capitation fee. Each was given a house and
garden, rent free, and could take boarders.</p>

<p>More than forty applications for the mastership
were received and the Rev. John Richard
Blakiston was appointed. Born in 1829 he was
educated at Trinity College, Cambridge, where
he gained a Scholarship. In 1853 he was
Second Classic and took Mathematical Honours.
A Fellowship Examination was to be held in
October, 1854, and Mr. Blakiston was studying<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_150" id="Page_150">[Pg 150]</a></span>
for it, when Thring, who had been recently
appointed to Uppingham, offered him a post
there as a House-Master. After three-and-a-half
years he accepted the Headmastership of Preston
Corporation School and a year later&mdash;December,
1858&mdash;was appointed to Giggleswick. At the same
meeting of the Governors the Rev. Matthew Wood
was appointed Usher. Born in 1831 he was a
Scholar of S. Catherine's College, Cambridge,
and later an Assistant Master at Durham School.</p>

<p>John Langhorne was the only survivor of
the days of Butterton and almost immediately
he resigned and was succeeded by Mr. Arthur
Brewin, who had been trained as a teacher in
the Chelsea Training College and had served
under Blakiston at Preston. His salary was to
be &pound;130 a year. A Modern Language Master
was also chosen.</p>

<p>The following December the usual
examination took place and the Bishop of
Ripon appointed the Rev. Frederic William
Farrar, who at that time was a Fellow of
Trinity College, Cambridge, and a Master
at Harrow. This first report is important,
because of the great contrast it presents when
compared with later years. The School in 1859
was staffed by very able, young and ambitious
men, indeed Mr. Blakiston's intellectual capacity
and ability as a teacher were quite exceptional,
and the report speaks in terms of commendation<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_151" id="Page_151">[Pg 151]</a></span>
of the work of the School, especially of the boys
under Blakiston and Brewin.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 477px;">
<img src="images/image0151.jpg" width="477" height="668" alt="REV. J. R. BLAKISTON." title="" />
<span class="caption">REV. J. R. BLAKISTON.</span>
</div>

<p>In the next year 1860, the examiner
appointed was the Rev. J. T. B. Landon,
sometime Fellow of Magdalen College, Oxford;
the progress that he reported was by no means so
satisfactory as in the previous year. He praised
the efficiency of the staff, but he pointed out
that the pupils were not so advanced as to be
able to profit sufficiently from the teaching.
Similarly in 1861 there were no boys whose
knowledge corresponded with that of an average
sixth form in one of the greater Public Schools.</p>

<p>The causes were twofold. The number of
boys had steadily decreased from ninety-six in
Dr. Butterton's time, to fifty-six in 1860, and
thereafter to an even greater extent. The
consequence was that the competition became
considerably less acute, and the proportion of
boys from the neighbourhood considerably
greater. Such boys would clearly in the main
be less likely to profit by the efficiency of the
teaching than boys from a greater distance. But
there was a second and a contributory cause.
The anomalous position of the Master and Usher,
each of whom had a freehold in his office, had
led to awkward incidents under the late Headmaster.
But they were now accentuated by the
fact that both Master and Usher were young
men and were appointed at the same time. The<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_152" id="Page_152">[Pg 152]</a></span>
subordination of the Usher to the Master was
regulated by the Statutes of 1592, but in so
vague a manner that they allowed room for all
manner of evasion. It would be an unprofitable
task to discuss these differences in detail; let it
be sufficient to say that matters reached such
a pitch that the Master was summoned before
the Settle Bench of Magistrates on a charge of
excessive vigour in applying punishment, and
that the Usher was expected (though he did not
do so) to appear as a witness for the Prosecution.
The summons was dismissed, and the Master
exonerated from all blame, but such a procedure
was not calculated to enhance the prestige
of the School, or modify the mutual difficulties
of the Headmaster and Usher.</p>

<p>One of the chief of the minor causes of
complaint was the position of the boarders.
The advertisement issued for the purpose of
encouraging applicants for the posts of Master
and Usher had signified that both men could
take boarders and so increase their salary.
But Craven Bank, which was the Master's
residence, was quite unsuited for the housing
of boys. Butterton had only the attics to put
them in, and Blakiston found it impossible to
take any boys, except by allowing them to
live entirely with his own family, and inhabit
the same rooms, and for this he asked a
higher fee of &pound;75 a year. The Usher on<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_153" id="Page_153">[Pg 153]</a></span>
the other hand was given a smaller house,
but in April, 1859, the Governing Body spent
&pound;700 in enlarging it, and building what is
now the Sanatorium. By this means he was
able to take ten or twelve boys, keep them
quite separate from his own family, and board
them on lower terms than the Master at &pound;56.
As the numbers declined, the necessity for
both men to have boarders disappeared, and in
consequence the lower fees and the more
comfortable internal arrangements of the Usher's
house caused it to be more desirable in the
eyes of the parents, and in January, 1863, the
Usher had ten boarders, the Master one.</p>

<p>These were the more trivial causes of
complaint, but Mr. Blakiston had too big a
mind to suffer himself to be obsessed by the
accidentals. He was fighting, and consciously
fighting, a much bigger battle. Dr. Arnold had
fought and won it at Rugby some years before,
but the path at Giggleswick was not therefore
the easier. The real point at issue was the 1844
Scheme for the Management of the School. It
had driven away Dr. Butterton, it was harassing
his successor. Mr. Blakiston on one occasion
had to receive permission from the Governing
Body to have the floor raised on his dais in
the School, in order that he might have a better
view of the boys as a whole. He could not
arrange holidays without permission, he could<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_154" id="Page_154">[Pg 154]</a></span>
not admit the boys without authority, he could
not insist on a change in the pronunciation of
Latin without rousing the interference of the
Governors. The pronunciation, that is to-day
called "new," was introduced by Mr. Blakiston
in 1860, as well as a novel method of
pronouncing Greek; he tried in vain to induce
other Headmasters to follow his example.</p>

<p>These restrictions were particularly harassing
to an ambitious and enthusiastic man, and in
March, 1862, he applied to the Charity
Commissioners for an amendment of the Scheme.
They were unwilling to take any hand in it on
the mere motion of the Master, and their refusal
led to much recrimination. Men, anonymous
and otherwise, wrote to the Newspapers
commenting on the decadence of the School
in efficiency and numbers, and the subject
became well-worn. In the midst of it Mr.
Blakiston received generous and unexpected
support. Mr James Foster, a City of London
Merchant, who had been educated at Giggleswick
and had property in the neighbourhood,
heard of the dissension that was going on, and
read the published pamphlets of Mr. Blakiston.
He accordingly asked his nephew and partner&mdash;Mr.
James Knowles&mdash;to wait upon Mr. Blakiston
with the offer of &pound;500 wherewith he might be
enabled to continue his efforts. James Knowles
also wrote independently to the Charity<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_155" id="Page_155">[Pg 155]</a></span>
Commissioners, as a member of the public
anxious for the welfare of a School in whose
neighbourhood he owned property. He called
attention to the differences which had arisen
between the Master and the Usher and the
consequent depression of the School, and desired
that they should open an investigation themselves
in the interests of the Public.</p>

<p>Meanwhile the Governors had at last
bestirred themselves and in September, 1862, had
caused a letter to be written to the Commissioners,
asking for an amendment to the Scheme. They
suggested that, in accordance with Mr. Blakiston's
suggestion, the area, from which members of
their body could be chosen, should be slightly
extended and their numbers raised from the
statutory eight to fifteen. They put forward
the names of seven additional members, but on
two declining the honour, they reduced the
number to five. The great danger of the
previous number of eight drawn from the small
area of the Parish of Giggleswick had lain in
the tendency to choose men, who were closely
allied one to another by ties of relationship
and so possibly of prejudice. In 1864 the
Scheme was so amended and the new
Governors were chosen. They included three
men, who soon shewed a very real, active
and enlightened interest in the prosperity of
the School&mdash;Sir James Kay Shuttleworth, Mr.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_156" id="Page_156">[Pg 156]</a></span>
C. S. Roundell, and Mr. Walter Morrison.
One object had now been attained and the
way lay open for a more thorough amendment
of the position of the Master.</p>

<p>But first it will not be amiss to mention
other features of the School life. Potation Day
was celebrated to the usual accompaniment of
Figs until the year 1860, when the Charity
Commissioners objected to it and to the Governors'
dinners as a waste of trust funds. The
Governors declined to entertain the objection,
but limited the expenditure on the dinner given
by the Governors to themselves and the Masters
to &pound;12, and any further expense was to be borne
by the whole body of Governors present. The
following year the dinner was again held and
paid for as formerly, but in 1862 the differences
between the Master and Usher and the death of
one of the Governors gave them an opportunity
of omitting the dinner in a dignified manner.
Since that date the dinner has never been held.
Fig-day, as far as the boys were concerned, was
also celebrated this year but for the last time. In
1863 it was resolved that the customary payment
of three guineas by the Scholars for School fires
and cleaning should be discontinued and the
money which had been collected in the winter
of 1859-60 was to be applied to the purchase
by Mr. Blakiston of books for the School
Library. This is the first recorded intimation<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_157" id="Page_157">[Pg 157]</a></span>
of the buying of books for the Library, which
had been built by Dr. Butterton.</p>

<div class="caption"><p class="center">HECTOR CHRISTIE,</p>
<p class="center"><i>Chairman of the Governors.</i></p>
</div>
</div>

<p>In 1861 it was decided to purchase for
the School a clock not exceeding the value of
&pound;5 and also to erect a shed in the Schoolyard.
It was to be used as a playing and drilling
place for the boys in wet weather, but as the
estimated cost of it was &pound;80 the Governors
refrained from carrying the matter further until
July, 1862. In that year some members of a
committee, who had been appointed many years
earlier to promote the decoration in the re-building
of the School reported that they had &pound;66 3<i>s.</i> 9<i>d.</i>
in hand. This they offered to the Governors
to assist them in the building of the shed in an
ornamental style. In 1864 it was suggested that
the Building Committee should report on the
additional cost, for which the shed then in
course of erection could be converted into Fives
Courts. In 1865 Mrs. Kempson, of Holywell Toft
offered &pound;150 as a prize, to be called "The
Ingram Prize," in memory of her father, the
Rev. Rowland Ingram, sometime Headmaster.
Five years previously the Pupils Prize and the
Howson Prize had been suspended, but Mrs.
Kempson's offer was gratefully accepted. She
wished it to take the form, if possible, of a
Bible with references.</p>

<p>The Usher had already absented himself for
one term in order that he might undertake work<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_158" id="Page_158">[Pg 158]</a></span>
at Cirencester, but he found it uncongenial and
returned to Giggleswick. In June, 1864, he
definitely resigned. The Governors at once requested
permission from the Charity Commissioners
to suspend for six months the post of Usher and
to appoint a temporary Assistant to take the
work. It was inconvenient to have the freehold
occupied at a time when the Governing Body
were contemplating amendments to the 1844
Scheme. In the meantime the Master was
allowed the option of living in the Usher's house.</p>

<p>Henceforth the fortunes of the School
began to improve. The position had been so
unenviable that with the temporary vacancy in
the freehold of the Usher, the Governors and
the Headmaster began to consider seriously the
alteration of the Scheme of Management. The
Charity Commissioners had been approached
first in 1862, by Mr. Blakiston, and, after he had
been supported by the Governing Body, the
matter received official attention. An Inspector
was sent down in the early part of 1863, and
taking advantage of a reconciliation between
the Master and Usher, he refused to discuss or
enquire into the personal aspect of the matter.</p>

<p>His report described the financial resources
of the School, which consisted of 732 acres of
land, and produced a yearly income of over
&pound;1,120. There was also an increasing surplus
of revenue over expenditure, which three years<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_159" id="Page_159">[Pg 159]</a></span>
later amounted to little less than &pound;800. The
average number of boys during the years
1846-1860 had been eighty-three, and the
highest point had been ninety-six. This
according to the testimony of those, who had
the longest associations with the School, was a
considerably larger number than had ever been
reached at any previous period. In 1860 the
number had dropped to fifty-six, and at the
time of the Inspector's visit was fifty-one.
Ten of these were boarders, of whom nine
lived in the Usher's House, one with the
Headmaster. There was one day boarder; nine
lodged with strangers, four more with relatives,
the rest, twenty-seven in all, were home
boarders or boys coming to School from their
homes in the neighbourhood. The education
was mainly Classical, although some boys who
were intended for a commercial career were
excused Greek and Latin Verse, while almost
all learned both French and German.</p>

<p>The chief difficulty under which the School
was labouring, was the class of boy from which
it drew. The whole education was given free
and this tempted many parents to send their
sons, who in reality were not fitted to take
advantage of the curriculum provided. There
were exceptions, and some boys of humble
parentage had distinguished themselves in an
intellectual sphere, but their proportion was not<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_160" id="Page_160">[Pg 160]</a></span>
great. It was therefore suggested that tuition
fees should be imposed. Such a charge was
revolutionary and was stoutly condemned by
all the inhabitants living around. It formed the
battlefield for ten years. Face to face with
the Inspector, the Governors gave their consent
to the change, but presently local pressure became
so strong that they withheld it. But the short
Scheme of 1864 which enabled members of the
Governing Body to be chosen from a wider area,
and the consequent appointment of Sir James
Kay Shuttleworth gave a great impetus to
reform. There was now no faintness of heart.
The increased efficiency of the School became
a dominating idea, and the principle of capitation
fees was accepted. But it was impossible to carry
through such a principle without the consent
of the neighbourhood. Their enthusiasm could
hardly be looked for, but their goodwill was
indispensable. In 1865 their hostility was
lessened to the extent that a compromise was
suggested, by which fifty boys should always
be admitted free of capitation fee, and that
ability to read and write should be deemed
sufficient to gain admittance. The School had
never within living memory educated more
than ninety-six boys, and at this time the
numbers were down to thirty-seven, in 1864
they had been thirty-four, so that the suggested
number of free boys was perhaps somewhat<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_161" id="Page_161">[Pg 161]</a></span>
an exaggerated number. The Governors
replied by suggesting twenty-five boys drawn
from a radius of eight miles. This would
probably have sufficed for as many as would
be likely to benefit in the limited area, and the
limitation in area was only a return to the
original desire of the founder to educate boys
who were sons of parents in the neighbourhood.</p>

<p>In October, 1865, Mr. J. G. Fitch inspected
the School as an Assistant Commissioner, under
the Schools Enquiry Commission. There were
only twenty-two boys in the higher classes
learning Latin, and the Sixth Form consisted
of one, while only eight boys in all were able to
read a simple passage from a Latin Author. He
noticed several disadvantages under which the
School was labouring, and consequent upon
which it had declined. One of them was the
narrow and local character of the Governing
Body, but this had been recently amended by
the Scheme of 1864. Another was the obvious
one of the impossibility of having two masters,
one nominally subordinate to the other, and yet
each enjoying a freehold. Lastly, he pointed
out that there was no effective supervision by
the Governors over the boarding arrangements,
and he condemned the gratuitous character of
the instruction, which attracted boys for whom
the education at the National School would
have been sufficient.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_162" id="Page_162">[Pg 162]</a></span></p>

<p>The Report was issued and negotiations
went forward with regard to capitation fees.
The inhabitants of the Parish of Giggleswick
were quite open to compromise within a limited
extent. They were willing to reduce the
number of free Scholars, but they could hardly
be expected to waive their rights altogether.
Instead of fifty they suggested thirty-five as a
suitable number and the Governors agreed to
accept thirty but no longer wished them to be
chosen from a limited area. Limitation of area
was however a very important point in the eyes
of the Parish and they could not accept the offer.
A deadlock arose. Sir James Shuttleworth saw
the danger of jeopardizing the whole Scheme by
their inability to agree upon one point and he
boldly proposed to omit the clause altogether
and allow it to stand over, while the rest of the
Scheme was carried through. The Commissioners
were asked to give their consent to this omission,
and they were only very reluctantly persuaded
to do so, for they had considered it to be a very
important clause.</p>

<p>Even so a further difficulty arose. The
freehold of the Usher was in abeyance, and Mr.
Blakiston for the sake of the promised prosperity
of the School had been willing to waive his
rights but, when the question of capitation fees
was wholly dropped, he changed his mind and
proposed to retain his former position. The<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_163" id="Page_163">[Pg 163]</a></span>
whole Scheme was in danger, until the Governors
decided to point out to Mr. Blakiston that his
refusal would in no way impede some of the
essentials of the change but that, as they could not
intrude upon his privileges, he would, while he
retained the Mastership, continue to labour under
all the disadvantages, which had for seven
years made his position so irksome. He would
still be unable to appoint or dismiss his Assistants
and his power over the Scholars would not be
changed for the better. The Master's decision
was unaltered, but in March, 1866, he determined
to accept an appointment as a Government
Inspector of Schools and so the difficulty was
at an end.</p>

<p>The following May the Commissioners
promulgated the new Scheme and it will be as
well to discuss it at this point. All boys were
to be admitted who could read and write and
were not afflicted with any contagious disorder.
The Headmaster was to receive a salary of not
less than &pound;250 a year and was to be appointed
by the Governors subject to the approval of the
Bishop of Ripon, the Visitor of the School. He
could be dismissed by a two-thirds majority of
the Governors, without any cause being assigned.
A house was provided for him and he could
both appoint and dismiss all the Assistant Masters
and have complete and sole control over the
supervision and discipline of the boys. These<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_164" id="Page_164">[Pg 164]</a></span>
regulations were a great step forward and the
power of the Headmaster became a real power.
Scholarships were also to be given to
deserving boys, and they were to be tenable
at the School. This was a new departure and had
been suggested by the desire to impose capitation
fees, which would in particular cases be excused.
The Scholarships under the amended Scheme
would be spent in part payment of the boarding
fees. Leaving Exhibitions were also to be
awarded and were intended to supplement the
various moneys massed under the heading of
Burton Rents.</p>

<p>The year 1865 was marked also by another
equally notable enquiry. At the half-yearly
meeting a Committee was appointed to enquire
into the advisability of extending the boarding
accommodation. The present arrangements were
not satisfactory. The Usher's house could not
accommodate more than ten boys, the Master's
not so many. Any other boys from a distance
were compelled to live with anyone in the
village, who was willing to take them. The
boys would be under no proper supervision and
frequently the conditions would be not even
sanitary. There was a clear need for an
enlarged building, where as many boys could live,
as were attracted to a school, which had many
natural advantages.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 703px;">
<img src="images/image0164.jpg" width="703" height="425" alt="CRICKET GROUND." title="" />
<span class="caption">CRICKET GROUND.</span>
</div>

<p>The Committee issued their report in<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_165" id="Page_165">[Pg 165]</a></span>
October and proposed that a Boarding-house
should be built and a level piece of ground
provided in its vicinity for Football and Cricket.
The Boarding-house was to provide a dining-hall,
rooms for preparatory studies and dormitories
for fifty boys, together with apartments for a
Master in charge. The Trust Funds were
not sufficient to build the School up afresh,
with new Boarding-houses and new Class-rooms
and it was a debateable question what site they
should choose. The first proposal was to use
the recently built School and convert the upper
room into a dormitory and so increase the
accommodation with a minimum of expense.
But the close proximity of the Churchyard gave
a suggestion of insanitariness to the site and the
absence of playing fields made it impossible.
There was a further choice. Near Craven
Bank was a certain amount of land belonging
to Mr. Robinson and also a field of five acres.
Other sites were suggested including one between
the Workhouse and the Station but finally in
January, 1866, the plot of land near Craven
Bank was bought for &pound;375. Mr. Ingram's
house&mdash;at the present time occupied by the
Headmaster&mdash;was offered to the Governors for
&pound;2,600 subject to Mrs. Kempson's life interest,
but it was not accepted. There was a further
question of the lines on which the Boarding-house
should be run. The alternatives were,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_166" id="Page_166">[Pg 166]</a></span>
to let the buildings to the Master on a rent
of six per cent. on the total outlay and allow
him to make what money he could out of the
pupils, or to adopt what was called the Hostel
System. The Master would then have a limited
control over the internal discipline of the boys,
but the other responsibilities would rest with
the Governors. All profit could then be
appropriated by them with a view to the adoption
of a Sinking Fund and an Exhibition Fund.
Finally the Hostel System was decided upon.
In March, 1866, Sir James Kay Shuttleworth,
Mr. Carr and Mr. Morrison were appointed as
a Committee to obtain plans for the erection of
a Boarding-house and to prepare a scheme of
management for it.</p>

<p>Mr. Blakiston's resignation was accepted at
the same meeting, and Mr. Thomas Bramley
was appointed as his temporary successor. He
had already been acting as an Assistant in the
place of the Usher, and his salary was now
raised to &pound;250 a year, and he was liable to
supersession at three months' notice; he had
no freehold, and was only intended to act as
Master for a limited period. Before closing the
Chapter on Mr. Blakiston's career at Giggleswick
it will be well to recapitulate briefly some of the
excellent work that he had accomplished. He
had come in a time of transition. Education
throughout England was in the melting-pot.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_167" id="Page_167">[Pg 167]</a></span>
Giggleswick itself had very considerable
opportunities of expanding into one of the
foremost Schools in the North of England. The
population was growing rapidly. New industries
were springing up on every hand. A generation
was coming to manhood, whose needs were as
yet a matter for speculation. But Giggleswick
had a traditional hold upon the minds of the
North, it had also a rich endowment. Was it
prepared to meet the necessities of the hour, or
was it to continue in the same self-centred
policy that had served well enough in the past?
Mr. Blakiston answered the question at once.
He was young, he was ambitious, he was a
scholar. He was also in his ideas a revolutionary.
It is not difficult to picture the result.
Thrown into the midst of a slow-moving
machinery, alone in his estimate of the potential
greatness of the School, supremely conscious of
his mission, he found himself a solitary. There
are two methods of progress. One to oil the
old cog-wheels and pray for progression.
Another to point out the clogging nature of the
machinery and propose a new device. He chose
the latter method. It was bold and dangerous.
But he went through with it courageously. The
numbers dropped rapidly, the fame of the School
suffered a relapse, but in the end the victory
was his. Before he retired, one new scheme had
been adopted, another and a better one was<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_168" id="Page_168">[Pg 168]</a></span>
awaiting confirmation, the suggestion of a new
Boarding-house was being pressed forward, and
the field was clear for the great and revolutionary
change&mdash;the adoption of a system of capitation
fees. The subsequent prosperity of the School
owed much of its swift development to the
Headmastership of Mr. Blakiston, and it is a
grateful task to record it.</p>

<h2>A New Era.</h2>


<p><span class="dropcap">O</span>N the resignation of Mr. Blakiston, in
March, 1866, the Rev. Thomas Bramley,
an Assistant Master, was appointed
temporary Headmaster. The Charity Commissioners
had been asked for their advice, and had
expressly stipulated that the temporary office
should not carry with it any freehold. After
holding this position for eighteen months, Mr.
Bramley sent in his resignation in October,
1867. The Governors held a meeting to
consider the position, and a letter was read
voicing the opinion of the inhabitants of the
neighbourhood that a permanent Headmaster
should be appointed. They shewed that the
numbers of the School proved that the education
received had value in the eyes of the locality,
and they suggested that a permanent Headmaster
would be more likely to take a close interest in
the boys. The Governors replied that they
could not see their way to making a permanent
appointment, until the Boarding-house had
been completed and the regulations drawn up
for boys who wished to reside with strangers in
the neighbourhood.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 681px;">
<img src="images/image0169.jpg" width="681" height="476" alt="THE HOSTEL, 1869." title="" />
<span class="caption">THE HOSTEL, 1869.</span>
</div>

<p>The Plans for a Boarding-house had been<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_170" id="Page_170">[Pg 170]</a></span>
going forward rapidly, and in May, 1867, the
Charity Commissioners had sanctioned the
expenditure by the Governors of &pound;6,400. The
income of the Trust had for some years shewn
a surplus of revenue over expenditure, and this
surplus then amounted to over &pound;1,200; the
further &pound;5,000 was obtained from the proceeds
of the sale of the Rise Estate, in 1863.
The Boarding-house was to be built by Mr.
Paley, a grandson of the Archdeacon, and was
to contain Dormitories for forty-nine boys and
studies for eighteen.</p>

<p>In December, 1867, Mr. Michael Forster
was appointed provisional Headmaster for a
single year. It was particularly pointed out to
him that the position would not carry with it
any claim to be appointed to the permanent post,
when it was determined that such should be
filled up. Mr. Forster had taken a First Class
in Classical Moderations, and a Second in the
Final School, and in addition had won a
Winchester Scholarship in Mathematics at New
College, and had "read Mathematics as high
as Plane Trigonometry."</p>

<p>The numbers of the School steadily
increased, and in the Easter Term of 1868
there were sixty-six boys, and in the following
Michaelmas Term sixty-seven, of whom four
boarded in the Master's House, and eleven in
Lodging Houses. The rest were day-boys<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_171" id="Page_171">[Pg 171]</a></span>
living at home. The majority were very young:
twenty-two boys were under twelve, and forty-one
between the ages of twelve and sixteen.</p>

<p>In May, 1869, the Governors proceeded to
the appointment of a permanent Headmaster.
Mr. Michael Forster had been continued in his
provisional post for a few months, and had
witnessed a further increase in the numbers of
the School, which at that period stood at
seventy-three. The regulations for the conduct
of the School had been drawn up, and the
Headmaster was to receive a House rent-free
and an assured income of &pound;250, with a further
additional sum for each boy, not exceeding
fifty in number, who should board for a year in
the Hostel or in the Master's House. The
maximum would then amount to &pound;750, but a
further sum of &pound;250 was possible, if the
Governors deemed it expedient to build a second
Hostel to accommodate another fifty boys.</p>

<p>For the first time in the history of the
School it was not necessary for applicants to be
in Holy Orders, but the master must be a
member of the Church of England, and a
graduate of one of the Universities of Oxford,
Cambridge or Dublin. Under the new Scheme
of Management the appointment of Assistant
Masters, but not their salaries, and the control of
the internal discipline and conduct of the School
were to be in his sole charge. But the regulations<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_172" id="Page_172">[Pg 172]</a></span>
for the admission of boys and for the subjects
of instruction were to be made by the Governing
Body.</p>

<p>A scheme had been drawn up by a Sub-Committee,
whereby the charge for Boarders
was fixed at &pound;80 per annum and &pound;5 of each
boarder's charges was to be appropriated to
Free Scholarships and Exhibitions. The division
of the School into an Upper and Lower Division
was maintained and the subjects in the latter
were to be English in all its branches, Arithmetic
and the Accidence of Latin. The Upper School
in time was to consist of two sides, Classical
and Modern. The Classical side had as its
especial object the preparation of boys for the
English Universities, whereas the Modern side
was intended to give instruction in Latin,
French, German, English Literature, Mathematics,
History, Physical Geography, and, when the
numbers of the School should increase, Chemistry
or some other branch of Natural Science. Latin
could be omitted with the concurrence of the
Master and parents in individual cases. Provision
was also made for an increased and
efficient staff of Masters, some of whom should
be resident in the Hostel.</p>

<p>There were four principal applicants for
the Headmastership and on May 26, 1869, the
Governors elected as Headmaster the Rev.
George Style, Fellow of Queens' College,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_173" id="Page_173">[Pg 173]</a></span>
Cambridge, who since the beginning of 1868
had been an Assistant Master at Clifton College.</p>

<p>The staff of Masters consisted of Mr. Style,
the Headmaster, Mr. C. H. Jeaffreson, late
Scholar of Lincoln College, Oxford, the Second
Master, without however a freehold, Mr. Arthur
Brewin, who was still in charge of the Lower
School, which at this time came rather to be
known as the Junior or Preparatory School, and
Herr Stanger who visited the School on certain
days each week in order to teach German.</p>

<p>When Mr. Style came he found fifty-six
boys in the School; of these, three became
boarders in the Hostel, fifteen were boarding in
various houses in the neighbourhood and the
rest lived with their parents. In March, 1870,
at the Annual Meeting, the Headmaster reported
that there were sixty-one boys in the School
of whom nine were in the Hostel and sixteen in
private Boarding-houses. The system of
Private Boarding-houses constituted a difficulty
common to many of the older schools in England
at this period. It was not possible to put a
sudden stop to a practice that had been prevalent
for the most part of three centuries and yet the
accommodation in many of these lodging-houses
was inadequate and the sanitary arrangements
most prejudicial to health. It is only necessary
to glance at the regulations which the Governors
thought fit to make to realize how unrestricted<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_174" id="Page_174">[Pg 174]</a></span>
had been the life of the boys who lodged in
such houses. Henceforward no boy could live
in a house, other than his parents', unless the
tenant had received a license from the Governing
Body. No boy was to be allowed to leave the
house after 7-0 p.m. in Winter, and 9-0 p.m. in
Summer. No boy should enter a Public House,
or smoke or play cards, and any breach of the
rules was to be forthwith reported to the Headmaster.
This was the first occasion on which
any rules had been laid down. Eventually the
private Boarding-houses gave place to the Hostel,
where greater opportunities existed for study
and discipline; in 1871 only four such private
boarders remained and soon afterwards there
were none.</p>

<p>As soon as the Endowed Schools Act had
been passed in 1869 the Governors of Giggleswick
began to consider a new scheme for the
management of the School. On May 30, 1870,
Mr. D. R. Fearon, an Assistant Endowed Schools
Commissioner, came down to confer with the
Governors. He suggested that the foundations
of Giggleswick and Sedbergh should be
amalgamated and that out of their joint funds
two first-grade schools should be established,
one Classical, one Modern; and that in some
respects it would be more convenient that
Sedbergh should be the Modern School, because
at that time it was almost in abeyance and<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_175" id="Page_175">[Pg 175]</a></span>
therefore the difficulties would be less great. If
the Governors of Giggleswick had not already
expended large sums in building, the Commissioners
would have approved a scheme for
removing both schools and establishing one
central foundation for Classical and Modern
studies, but this was then impossible. It was
proposed that the Governing Body should
be increased and no teaching be gratuitous,
but in order to provide for the satisfaction of
local requirements a Third Grade School should
be established in Settle either as a separate school
or as an upper branch of the National School
or alternatively they should annex to Giggleswick
School a Junior Department with a lower fee
and a limitation of age. Further, in consequence
of the twelfth clause of the Endowed Schools
Act, some provision was to be made out of the
Giggleswick Endowments for the education of
girls. These suggestions were not all carried out.
The two foundations were treated separately,
except that Sedbergh was established as a First-grade
Secondary School with Classics as its main
subject, and Giggleswick was similarly established
on Modern lines.</p>

<p>The new regulations for the government of
the School came into force in 1872. The Governing
Body was to consist of sixteen members; eight
were to be Representative Governors, and were
to consist of the Justices of the Peace in the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_176" id="Page_176">[Pg 176]</a></span>
Petty Sessional Divisions in which Giggleswick
and Sedbergh were respectively situated;
representatives nominated by S. John's College,
Cambridge, Owen's College, Manchester, and the
Governing Bodies of certain neighbouring
Grammar Schools. The remaining eight were
to be co-optative. The Vicar of Giggleswick
ceased to be an ex-officio Governor and
the Bishop of Ripon was no longer the
official visitor of the School. His powers
were henceforward vested in the Crown.
The Headmaster had no freehold but was
liable to be dismissed at six months' notice
without cause assigned by a two-thirds majority
of the Governing Body, twice assembled for the
purpose. But on the other hand he was given
complete jurisdiction over the whole internal
management, teaching and discipline of the
School, and full power to appoint and dismiss
his Assistant Masters.</p>

<span class="caption">HOSTEL.</span>
</div>

<p>The question of free education at the
School was settled finally. Every boy admitted
into the School had to pay an entrance fee
not exceeding &pound;3 and a tuition fee not less
than &pound;12 or more than &pound;24. Fees for boarding in
the Hostel were not to exceed &pound;45. Certain
exemptions from tuition fees could be granted
as the reward of merit, and in a few instances
the boarding fees might be remitted for similar
reasons and to a limited extent. If the state<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_177" id="Page_177">[Pg 177]</a></span>
of the Trust Funds permitted, a leaving
Exhibition, to be called The Giggleswick
Exhibition, might be awarded for the purpose
of fitting the holder for some profession or
calling. It was to be given on the results of
an examination in Mathematics, Natural Science
or Modern Languages.</p>

<p>The most important clause in the scheme
was that which inaugurated the Shute
Exhibitions. Giggleswick had been founded
as a Free School, and the fundamental alteration
of its character had been vigorously opposed by
the inhabitants of the neighbourhood for close
upon ten years. They were fighting a losing
battle. It was clear that no school could
maintain the efficiency of its education without
the imposition of fees. One of its two
original characteristics must go. Either the
education must cease to be free, or it must lose
its former liberal element. For three hundred
years and more a Grammar School education
had been such that by its very breadth it
endeavoured to fit men for whatsoever walk in
life they intended to adopt. But in the
nineteenth century education was becoming more
expensive, and the old ideals could not be
maintained at the old cost. It is always an
odious task to change the character of a
benefaction, and to deprive people of long-standing
privileges, but on the other hand it is<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_178" id="Page_178">[Pg 178]</a></span>
essential to look at the matter from a different
standpoint. Did the imposition of fees rob
many boys of the chance of an education by
which they were likely to profit? The answer
is almost certainly in the negative. That there
were some few to whom a higher education
would be a gain is equally certain, and for these
provision was made. The bequests of Josias
Shute had been made in order to enable poor
scholars to go up to the University, and for
two hundred years the money was used in this
way. But in 1872 it was diverted. It was
henceforth to be applied to the payment of the
tuition fees of such boys as had for not less than
three years been educated at one or other of
the Public Elementary Schools in the Ancient
Parish of Giggleswick, and who should be
deserving of it. These boys were to be called
Shute Exhibitioners. The change has limited
the numbers of boys from the neighbourhood
who have been educated at the School, but the
results have been excellent. Many Shute
Exhibitioners have been enabled by this help
to fit themselves for various positions in life, in
which they have afterwards distinguished themselves,
and it is improbable that any have been
kept back by their failure to gain an Exhibition.
The Governors further determined to change
the character of the Lower School and make
the education received there similar to that of<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_179" id="Page_179">[Pg 179]</a></span>
a Preparatory School. In order to carry out
the second aspiration of the Endowed Schools
Commissioners, namely to "promote the
education of girls," the Governors were ordered
to pay &pound;100 yearly to some girls' schools, which
should be chosen later. This sum was paid to
the Endowed School for Girls at Skipton.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 672px;">
<img src="images/image0179.jpg" width="672" height="433" alt="THE LIBRARY." title="" />
<span class="caption">THE LIBRARY.</span>
</div>

<p>The subjects of instruction at the Grammar
School were fixed according to the ideas
prevalent for the promotion of "Modern"
Education. Natural Science was included,
and Latin found a place. Greek did not form
part of the regular course, but the Governors
could accord permission to learn it to such boys
as needed it to qualify them to enter an
University. The permission was frequently
granted, and in such cases Greek was taken in
place of German.</p>

<p>The establishment of the new scheme was
followed by a great development in the numbers
of the School. Whereas in March, 1871, there
were only fifty-eight boys, in the following March
there were sixty-seven, and in December, 1873,
one hundred and one. Never before in the
history of the School had the numbers, so
far as is known, reached a hundred, and the
rapid increase justified the decision of the
Governors to build the Hostel and to lower
the boarding fees. It is a remarkable fact
that although in the early part of 1872, no<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_180" id="Page_180">[Pg 180]</a></span>
boys had been required to pay any money for
tuition, yet no boy left the School when fees
were imposed later in the same year in
accordance with the provisions of the scheme.</p>

<p>It is probable that the provision made under
the Scheme for the teaching of Natural Science
contributed largely to the increase in numbers.
In January, 1872, the Headmaster had appointed
Dr. W. Marshall Watts, as an Assistant Master,
to take charge of the Science subjects, viz.:
Chemistry, Physics, and Botany in the Upper
School. At the same time arrangements were
made by the Governors for the building of the
first part of the Chemical Laboratory. The
plans for the buildings and all the arrangements
were carried out in accordance with the advice
and under the personal supervision of Dr.
Marshall Watts, who brought to bear upon the
subject the experience which he had lately
gained at Manchester Grammar School. In
consequence the Laboratory, which cost about
&pound;1,500, was excellently adapted to its purpose.
While the building operations were in progress,
the Science teaching was begun and carried on
under difficulties in two or more rooms at
Craven Bank, which was then empty. A new
residence for the Headmaster had been provided
by the Governors in 1872. Holywell Toft
had been built by the Rev. Rowland Ingram,
a son of the former Headmaster, and he<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_181" id="Page_181">[Pg 181]</a></span>
had used it as his residence while he was
Vicar of Giggleswick; when he resigned the
office, his sister Mrs. Kempson remained there.
In 1871 the Governors were given the
opportunity of purchasing it for &pound;2,000, and
in the following year it was used as the official
residence of the Headmaster.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 696px;">
<img src="images/image0181.jpg" width="696" height="431" alt="CLASS ROOMS AND LABORATORY." title="" />
<span class="caption">CLASS ROOMS AND LABORATORY.</span>
</div>

<p>The additions to the Hostel, rendered
necessary by the increase in numbers, were
sanctioned by the Charity Commissioners in
1874, and a sum of &pound;10,000 was named to
provide for the same, and for the provision of
further accommodation in the Laboratory. The
Hostel already provided accommodation for
forty-nine boys, but with the additions, which
included, besides other buildings, the whole of
the South Wing, and on the North the present
Dining Hall and the Dormitories above it, room
was made for about sixty-six more boys. From
this time also the three-term system was adopted.
Previously the School had assembled in the
middle of August until Christmas, after which
they came back for a long term extending from
January till July, with only a short holiday
at Easter. The holidays were now lengthened
from eleven or twelve weeks in the year to
fourteen.</p>

<p>In 1876 the numbers had increased to such
an extent that it was found necessary to build
new Class-Rooms. Teaching had been still<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_182" id="Page_182">[Pg 182]</a></span>
carried on in what is now known as the Old
School, and the accommodation for some time
had been so inadequate that rooms in the Hostel
itself had been utilized. The Governors therefore
determined to build rooms sufficient for one
hundred and twenty boys, and to add a
Lecture-room to the Laboratory. A difficulty
arose about the site. It was at first proposed
to lessen the expenditure by adding to the
Old School, where there was a sufficient
space, but such an addition would have
permanently divided the life of the School,
and apart from the question of finance, it was
clearly of the utmost importance that the Class-rooms
should be adjacent to the Hostel. This
course was finally decided upon, and six Class-rooms
were built. The total cost of these
buildings and of the Hostel additions reached
over &pound;13,000, and the Governors were
empowered to sell certain of their North Cave
Estates, and to borrow &pound;6,000 from the
Governors of Sedbergh. This debt was finally
paid off in 1881 out of surplus revenue, which
was so great that in 1878 Fives Courts were
built out of it, and three years later
&pound;1,100 was spent in alterations and additions
to the Headmaster's House. In spite of this
considerable expenditure the Governors were
still able to put aside each year the sum of
&pound;800.</p>

</div>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_183" id="Page_183">[Pg 183]</a></span></p>

<p>The numbers continued to increase rapidly,
and in 1884 the Charity Commissioners agreed
to the proposal of the Governors to extend the
Class-rooms. Those already standing had
been built in such a way that it was an
easy undertaking to add to them. The road
up High Rigg alone stood in their way, but
permission was obtained to divert it and make
a better road further South. On the ground-floor
two new Class-rooms were built and
connected by a corridor on the West side, while
above it Big School, eighty feet long by thirty feet
broad, absorbed one of the former Class-rooms,
and supplied what had previously been a great
defect in the arrangements of the School. It
was capable of holding between three and four
hundred people, and was thus of the utmost use
on Speech Days and other great occasions,
besides providing a fit place for assembling the
whole School for Prayers and Concerts. At the
southern end of the building a transverse
addition was built, of which the lower half was
to serve as a Library, and above were two Class-rooms
opening into the Big School. Thus in
addition to the Science Block, the School
Buildings now consisted of Big School and nine
large Class-rooms, each of which was capable
of holding from twenty to twenty-five boys.
Another long-felt need was also supplied. A
large Covered Playground was erected on the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_184" id="Page_184">[Pg 184]</a></span>
West side of the Class-rooms. It was one
hundred and five feet long and fifty feet broad,
with a height of forty feet; its floor was paved
with wood, and its walls were cemented.
There a large proportion of the School could
amuse themselves on days when the inclemency
of the weather made out-door pursuits difficult.
The cost of these buildings was defrayed out
of the Trust Funds, but at the same time a
Gymnasium and Changing Room were added
by money provided by the subscriptions of Old
Boys and other friends of the School, and in
particular of Mr. John Birkbeck, one of the
Governors. The cost of this part alone amounted
to over &pound;1,300.</p>

<p>The twenty years from 1866 to 1886 saw
the whole character of the School transformed.
A complete set of new buildings had been
erected with boarding accommodation for one
hundred and fifty boys, and Class-rooms for
two hundred and forty, all within one central
space. Over twenty thousand pounds had been
expended, and yet it had been found possible
to meet these many claims without unduly
depleting the total revenue arising from the
Estates in the possession of the Governors in
the East-Riding. The rental in 1894 was over
&pound;700, and shewed a decrease of a little less
than &pound;500 a year. That such a sudden and
swift development should have been possible<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_185" id="Page_185">[Pg 185]</a></span>
reflects the greater credit on the foresight of
Sir James Kay Shuttleworth and his fellow
Governors and on the energy and enthusiasm
of the Headmaster.</p>

<span class="caption">BIG SCHOOL.</span>
</div>

<p>No branch of the School life failed to grow
during these eventful years; in work and in play
success was pre-eminent. Dr. Marshall Watts was
possessed of new buildings and up-to-date apparatus,
and he did not fail to use them to the full.
Mr. Style himself superintended the Mathematical
work of the School, and both Mathematics and
Science turned many a Giggleswick boy towards
paths which brought honour and distinction to
himself and his School. Between the years 1880
and 1891 five Scholarships were won for Mathematics,
and nine first-class Mathematical Honours.
In Natural Science thirteen boys won Scholarships
at Oxford or Cambridge, and eleven took first
classes. One Classical Scholarship was gained,
the Junior Mathematical Scholarship at Oxford
and one Mathematical Fellowship at Cambridge.
Two boys passed into the Indian Civil Service
direct from the School. Many others won
Second-class Honours or Exhibitions or Scholarships
at other places and several were placed
extremely high in the Honours List of the
London University Matriculation. These successes
speak for themselves, and cover only a period
of eleven years. The last decade of the century
was almost as fruitful.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_186" id="Page_186">[Pg 186]</a></span></p>

<p>At this point it will be as well to picture
more definitely in the mind the characteristics
of the School. A contributor to the <i>Giggleswick
Chronicle</i>, in June, 1893, has described the
conditions as he found them on his admission
in 1871. The Dining-room stood where the
Senior Reading-room now is, but it extended
further back, including what is now a passage
and the Servants' Hall. The eight Studies at the
end of the lower passage formed a single large
room for evening preparation and for prayers.
Gas was not used, but oil-lamps were in
every study and the school-room in the Hostel
was lighted by candles fitted into tall metal
candlesticks heavily weighted. The Old School
was the chief place for work and the practice
was continued of having the Junior School, which
corresponded to the more ancient Lower School,
upstairs and the Upper School consisting of
three classes worked on the ground floor. The
Class-room and Library were soon called into
use and as the numbers rapidly increased two
large rooms at the South end of the Hostel which
had been recently built were also used. Science
Classes were held in Craven Bank.</p>

</div>

<p>In 1877 the death of Sir James Kay
Shuttleworth robbed Giggleswick of a firm
friend. His position as Chairman of the
Governors had enabled him largely to mould
the destinies of the School during its very<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_187" id="Page_187">[Pg 187]</a></span>
difficult and important period of transition.
He had been the most strenuous supporter
of all who had the true interests of the
School at heart, and he had fought amongst
the foremost in the struggle for a new Scheme.
Sir James Shuttleworth came to Giggleswick
free from local prejudice and trained in
educational work and the success that attended
the School from 1872 onwards is largely due to
the broad-minded sagacity that he displayed.</p>

<p>Lord Frederick Cavendish succeeded him as
Chairman and for five years gave Giggleswick
of his best. He was followed by his brother
Lord Edward Cavendish, who held the office
for nearly nine years till his death in 1891.
In that year Mr. Hector Christie entered
upon his long term as Chairman. Ever
since the Scheme of 1864 the Governing
Body had been an exceedingly strong one.
In addition to those already mentioned there
were at different times Mr. Morrison, Mr. C. S.
Roundell, Rev. H. I. Swale, and Mr. John
Birkbeck, junior. All these men took a great
individual interest in the School and as a body
they were generous and progressive.</p>

<p>From time immemorial the School had
attended Giggleswick Parish Church for services
on Sunday, and during this period two pews,
one for the Headmaster and one for the Second
Master, were set apart immediately on the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_188" id="Page_188">[Pg 188]</a></span>
North and South sides of the Communion Table.
Boarders sat in their respective Master's pew or
overflowed into other seats in the Church. But
with increasing numbers it became difficult to
provide seats for the School without interfering
unduly with the convenience of the general
congregation. Accordingly at the beginning of
the year 1875 the School was allowed to have
the use of the Church on Sundays for a special
service at 9-0 a.m., but they still attended the
ordinary afternoon service at 3-0. This system
continued for five years until in 1880 the
Governors laid on gas in the Church and put
in suitable fittings. The School was then
enabled to have a second special service at 7-0
p.m. A few years later the Rev. W. H.
Coulthurst, the Vicar, consented to a plan for
the restoration of the Church, and it was only
fitting that the School should take a special
interest in the work. The Headmaster issued
an appeal for financial help to the Old Boys
and to the School; &pound;120 was collected for the
General Fund, special contributions were made
to the new organ, and the Headmaster and
Boys, Past and Present, gave the Church a
clock with S. Mary's chimes. This clock
replaced an old one, which was put in the
School Museum. Its works were made partly
of wood and it required daily winding by hand,
a process which occupied a considerable time.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_189" id="Page_189">[Pg 189]</a></span>
The School services during the progress of
the restoration were held in Big School,
while the Old School had been given over
to the Vicar for the holding of the Parish
services. The Church was re-opened on May 11,
1892, by the Bishop of Richmond, and on the
following Sunday the sermon at the first School
service was preached by the Rev. Delaval
Ingram, a son of the former Vicar and a
grandson of the Rev. Rowland Ingram, the
former Master of the School.</p>

</div>

<p>During Mr. Style's Headmastership Athletics
also became a permanent part of the School
life. The Cricket-field had been purchased in 1869,
and had been used for both Cricket and Football.
Unfortunately it was a fair-weather ground.
Its foundations rested on peat, and continuous
play all the year round did not improve it. The
first matches that were played took place in the
early seventies, when the Hostel had as yet
only fourteen boys, but in spite of their small
numbers a match was arranged between them
and the rest of the School. Later on other
School fixtures were mapped out, and the great
days of the year were when Sedbergh, and, for
a time, Lancaster School were the opponents.
Between the years 1871 and 1895 forty-six
Cricket Matches were played against Sedbergh,
of which nine were drawn and seventeen won.
Similarly during the period 1880-1895 twenty-<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_190" id="Page_190">[Pg 190]</a></span>four
Football Matches took place, and
Giggleswick won ten. The two Schools
were equally matched, and the football
of both reached a high standard. The
Swimming Bath had been built in 1877, and
was roofed in for use in winter. The Fives
Courts were well attended, and Golf was begun
on the playing fields at a later time. In 1893
a new Football Field was bought and an
adjoining one rented. This was a material
help to the School Athletics, for it was one
of the few level fields in the district that was not
in the winter almost permanently a marsh.</p>

<span class="caption">THE SCHOOL BUILDINGS.</span>
</div>

<p>One of the most distinguishing features
of the School was Music. The first resident
Master was Mr. Charles Frederick Hyde, who
came to the School in 1886, and for nearly
seven years organized the music. With
the help of Mr. L. Watkins all branches
of the subject were developed, and, unlike the
custom of most other Schools, music teaching
was not cramped or regarded merely as an
unfortunate necessity, but was given considerable
opportunity. When Mr. Hyde died in 1893,
his friends combined together, and, collecting
&pound;560, presented to the School Trustees a fine
Organ, which was placed in Big School.
This was a striking testimony to the appreciation
that he had inspired after just seven years'
work. Three men have up till the present<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_191" id="Page_191">[Pg 191]</a></span>
succeeded to Mr. Hyde's place, and musical
enthusiasm has been maintained at a very high
pitch.</p>

<p>The School Library had been begun under
Dr. Butterton in a room especially built for
the purpose. But as the centre of the School
life gradually changed and new Class-Rooms
were built near the Hostel, the Library was
transferred to its present position. For a time
each boy paid a small terminal subscription to
maintain it with a supply of books. Reading
in the Library was never compulsory, but a
number of boys would go there on wet afternoons
or at other free times, and it proved itself very
valuable. Among the Books in the School's
possession there is a copy of the "Breeches"
Bible; A Paraphrase and Note on the Epistles
of St. Paul, by John Locke, the Second Edition,
published in 1709; An Edition of Cocker's
Arithmetic, and several of the first collected
Editions of Charles Dickens.</p>

<p>The establishment of the Preparatory School
had led Mr. Style to consider the question of
providing a house for the boarding of younger
boys, who should in time come up to the Hostel.
Bankwell seemed a suitable building and was
taken on a lease in 1887. Mr. G. B. Mannock
was placed in charge. There was an excellent
garden attached and the house had rooms for
twenty boarders, while an adjoining field was<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_192" id="Page_192">[Pg 192]</a></span>
rented for games. Thus the boys living there
were able to keep almost entirely apart from the
older boys in the School, except in school-time.
Two years later Holly Bank was also taken for
the same purpose.</p>

<p>The Junior School had for a period of
nearly forty years been in the charge of Mr.
Arthur Brewin, who had succeeded John
Langhorne as Writing Master in 1859. He had
seen the complete development of the School
and had watched each of the many schemes of
management mature. His own department had
been completely revolutionized. Formerly it
had been a Writing School, in which generally
he had been accustomed to give an elementary
education, that in some cases was to be the
only book learning that the boys were ever to
get; but he eventually found himself teaching
boys whose average age was under twelve and
scarcely one of whom left the School before
going into the higher classes. In July, 1897,
he retired.</p>

<p>In November, 1896, what might have proved
an irreparable disaster came upon the Laboratory.
During the early hours of the morning a fire was
discovered in the Chemistry Room and it spread
to the rest of the building. Most fortunately
the Class-rooms and Hostel, which were both
separate from the Laboratory, were not injured
and the fire was quenched by 6-0 a.m. The<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_193" id="Page_193">[Pg 193]</a></span>
misfortune seemed only to inspire the Headmaster
and Dr. Watts to draw up plans for
replacing what was already an excellent
Laboratory with a still better one. In the
following term both the Chemistry and Lecture
Rooms were almost re-built and in 1899 a more
extensive scheme was carried out by which two
new Class-rooms, a Physical Laboratory and a
Science Library were designed together with
some smaller rooms, and the building fitly
completed the appearance of the School.</p>

<p>An Educational Exhibition was held at the
Imperial Institute, London, in 1900, and
many of the Schools of England exhibited their
ancient documents and summarized their schemes
of work. Giggleswick was allotted a certain
space and sent up a survey of its past history
and a detailed statement of its curriculum. In
the Sixth Form, the thirty-two teaching periods
a week were divided thus: Latin was allotted
six, Mathematics eight, English and Divinity
one each, Modern Languages eight, and Natural
Science eight. Boys who wished to take Greek
omitted German. In addition preparation for
the next day's work was done each evening and
on Saturday nights an essay or theme was set.
Drawing formed part of the regular work of the
School below the first three Forms. Singing
was taught to all the younger boys and a School
Choir had been formed consisting of boys and<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_194" id="Page_194">[Pg 194]</a></span>
masters. Nearly half the School learned
instrumental music, chiefly the Piano, and there
were one or two School Concerts given every
year and in addition concerts of classical music
were held every fortnight.</p>

<p>The School Museum occupied the place of
the Library in the Old School, and in it were
some particularly interesting specimens. The
Victoria Cave which had been discovered in
1837, was carefully explored by Mr. Tiddeman
and other experts, and after five years' work the
results were presented in 1878 to the School
Museum. In 1893 Mr. J. Walling Handby sent
a Collection of Forty-one Skins of New Zealand
Birds, and Mr. Clapham, of Austwick, gave a
valuable Collection of British Birds. In addition
there were Collections of Minerals (notably
the Keate Collection), Fossils, Eggs, and South
Sea Shells. The Museum was open at certain
times to the public. School Societies flourished.
The Photographic Society was instituted in 1876,
the Debating Society in 1877, and a Literary
Society in 1879.</p>

<p>Cricket, Football, Golf, Fives, Swimming,
and Athletic Sports, all found their place in the
School year. The School Colours&mdash;Red and
Black&mdash;were worn by most of the School, but,
as is common, distinctive colours were assigned
to members of the first two elevens in Cricket,
and the two fifteens in Football. Inter-School<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_195" id="Page_195">[Pg 195]</a></span>
and Dormitory Matches were also played.</p>

<p>In September, 1897, an Old Boys' Club was
formed under the presidency of the Headmaster
in order to maintain a closer union between past
and present members of the School, and to
organize Meetings and Athletics. The Scheme
met with considerable support, and from
time to time meetings and dinners have been
held.</p>

<p>For the most part of the last twenty years
of the century the numbers of the School had
been too great for the Hostel to include them
all. In 1894 there were two hundred and eight
boys in the School, of whom only twenty to
twenty-five were Day Boys. Craven Bank had
consequently been used as another Dormitory.
Bankwell, and for a time Hollybank, were
filled with some of the younger boys. The great
difficulty under which the School laboured was
the frequent change of Masters, especially of
those who took the higher forms. It was
therefore suggested that the House System as
opposed to the Dormitory System should be
given a trial. Hollybank was no longer
needed in 1900 to take the overplus from
Bankwell, and a Master was put in charge of
it, in the hope that older boys would come.
The attractions were twofold. In the first place
it was intended to give the Master in charge
of it an opportunity of marrying and the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_196" id="Page_196">[Pg 196]</a></span>
expectation of a sufficient income to make him
content to continue at Giggleswick. In the
second place it was hoped that the fact of a
man being married would tend to induce parents
to send their boys more readily. Unfortunately
the scheme was not wholly successful, and was
soon abandoned.</p>

<p>Every boy in the School attended the
Gymnasium, which since its opening in 1887
had been under the superintendence of Sergeant-Major
Cansdale. Many boys also learned
carpentry in the Joiners' Shop, which had been
fitted with benches and lathes, and other
necessary materials in the upper room of the
Old School.</p>

<p>This brief summary of the School life was
depicted at the Educational Exhibition and it
was a worthy record for a small School. It will
be seen that the main characteristic of the
School was that it was amongst the first to
adapt itself to modern needs. It is probably no
exaggeration to say that at that period no
school in England could approach Giggleswick
in the practical teaching of Science; to this
was due a great measure of its success. In every
branch of school life excellence was attained, an
unusual number of Scholarships were won and
the Football Fifteen for two successive seasons
in 1894 and 1895 never had a single point
scored against them in any School Match.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_197" id="Page_197">[Pg 197]</a></span></p>

<p>Throughout the history of the School there
have been very few signs of literary exuberance.
Only one School song has been written, called
"Now Reds" by Mr. J. R. Cornah for the
<i>Giggleswick Chronicle</i>, April, 1898. The <i>Giggleswick
Chronicle</i> was begun in 1880 but it was edited
by Masters and was intended rather to place on
record the terminal life of the School than
aspire to literary eminence. As such it has
achieved its purpose and is a valuable and
interesting record. But apart from official
matter boys have shewn themselves very loth
to summon forth their energies and write.
With one exception no paper, written by
boys alone, has been published since the
<i>Olio</i> caused Sir Walter Scott to smile.</p>

<p>The Boer War claimed a certain number of
Old Boys, some of whom did extremely well.
Captain H. H. Schofield distinguished himself at
the Battle of Colenso, and helped to rescue two
guns, for which he gained the Victoria Cross,
while Lieutenant S. A. Slater was largely
responsible for a clever and daring capture of
Bultfontein. Altogether at least nineteen boys
went out.</p>

<h2>The Chapel.</h2>


<div class="blockquot">
<p style="text-align:right;">House of Commons Library,</p>
<p style="text-align:right;padding-right:3em;">March 1, 1897.</p>

<p>Dear Style,</p>

<p>I have an idea in my head of offering to build the
School a Chapel with a Dome as an architectural
experiment, employing Jackson, the famous Oxford
Architect. One would call it the Diamond Jubilee
Memorial. Site the knoll in the Cricket Field. We
have very few domes in England and it might give a
hint to others.</p>

<p>But I should like to hear any suggestions of yours.
A Domed Building on the site should look well. It
would need much thinking out as we do not understand
Domes. The Round Church at Cambridge gives some
hints.</p>

<p style="margin-left:40%">Yours truly,</p>
<p style="margin-left:60%"><span class="smcap">W. Morrison</span>.</p>

<p>Rev. G. Style.</p>
</div>

<p>This letter was received by the Headmaster
on March 2. The effect of such news
coming without any previous warning can be
imagined. The difficulty of commemorating the
Diamond Jubilee year had seemed overwhelming
and this unexpected offer from Mr. Walter
Morrison dissipated the troubles in a moment.
In the second place a School Chapel had alone
been wanting to complete the seclusion and
privacy of the School, and hitherto the prospect
of such a building had seemed unattainable. It
was now offered as a gift.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 485px;">
<img src="images/image0198.jpg" width="485" height="670" alt="WALTER MORRISON J.P." title="" />
<span class="caption">WALTER MORRISON J.P.</span>
</div>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_199" id="Page_199">[Pg 199]</a></span></p>

<p>Mr. Morrison had recently returned from
travelling in the East and had been greatly
impressed by one particular feature of Eastern
Architecture. The dome is almost universal in
Palestine, and Mr. Morrison desired that an
architectural experiment should be made in
England. He wished to see the School Chapel
built in the Gothic Style but with a dome. Mr.
T. G. Jackson, R.A., was approached upon the
subject and remembering that his former Master,
Sir Gilbert Scott, had always hoped to undertake
such a work, he gladly made his plans.</p>

<p>The aim of all the best Architecture is to
construct a building of such a kind that it will
withstand the ruin of the ages and will prove
an opportunity for doing well whatever it is
built for. The purpose of a house is that a
man should be able to live in it. The essence
of a church is that it should provide a place of
worship. It is easy enough to construct a
four-square building with accommodation for a
required number of people but brick walls are
not sufficient. Utility does not consist only in
adequate space; it has many other features,
closely inwoven with it. Fitness is the keynote
of beauty. Taken by themselves there is little
beauty to be seen in two parallel straight iron
lines running through the country-side, but
conceive of them as railway lines, adequately
and without any unnecessary waste of material<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_200" id="Page_200">[Pg 200]</a></span>
performing the office for which they were made,
and few sights can be more charged with the
very essence of beauty. The purpose that
underlies the construction and the complete
fulfilment of that purpose is beauty.</p>

<p>But a Church cannot be content only with
a building sufficiently well-built to hold its
worshippers and sufficiently in tone with its
surroundings to express the unity of art and
nature. It has a further form of expression that
it must satisfy. It is a religious building, and
as such its characteristics and its form must
exemplify religious tendencies and thought. A
barn can be supremely beautiful, but it does
not radiate the atmosphere of worship. A
Church must be characterized by certain great
and instinctive elements of grandeur, it must
breathe the spirit of reverence, it must, as
Ruskin says, "speak well and say the things
it was intended to say in the best words."
Giggleswick School Chapel may justly be
said to fulfil all these conditions. It is in
harmony with its surroundings, and it is a
structure of great architectural beauty, that is
to say, it expresses its purpose in the best way.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 685px;">
<img src="images/image0200.jpg" width="685" height="499" alt="THE CHAPEL EXTERIOR." title="" />
<span class="caption">THE CHAPEL EXTERIOR.</span>
</div>

<p>Every style of Architecture makes its own
peculiar appeal to mankind. One kind of
Church seems better adapted to the needs of
Englishmen; Eastern peoples prefer a different
style. Mr. Morrison proposed to take a<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_201" id="Page_201">[Pg 201]</a></span>
distinctive feature of each and make them one.
For the general building he chose the Gothic
style because, though not native to England, it
has imposed itself to an overwhelming extent
on the Parish Churches and Cathedrals of the
country, and to it he added a Dome. There is
one feature that these two apparent opposites
have in common. Gothic Churches vary greatly,
but many of them are notable for their appearance
of loftiness. The clustered columns seem
to lead the eye upwards to the roof, as if men
naturally went about the world cramped and
confined, and were now bidden turn their gaze
to the heights. A dome has a somewhat similar
effect: it carries on the gaze and it gives an
increased and unexpected vision. The bold
union of the two has created a School Chapel,
which satisfies every wish. It is suited to the
surrounding country, it is possessed of great
beauty, and it breathes the atmosphere of
worship.</p>

<p>But there is another consideration. One of
the most striking characteristics of boy-life is
the feeling of personal possession. Everything
that is of importance has a personal aspect.
Whatever a boy sees belonging to his own
School is at once invested with a curious
sanctity and defended with all the armour of
pride. It is of supreme importance that the
side of school life, the religious side, which<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_202" id="Page_202">[Pg 202]</a></span>
sometimes appeals to a boy with a greater force
than any other, should have a building of its
own. The Parish Church can never lay claim
to the same devotion, and therefore can
never exercise the same influence. A School
Chapel develops a feeling of unity and brotherhood;
such unity is less possible in a Parish
Church.</p>

<p>Buildings and surroundings have a power
to mould character. It is the big, silent
things of life that often really move a man:
the walls that he can learn to love and know,
and invest with life and memory. These feelings
are not recognized at the time, and it is well
that they should not be. Emotionalism and
probing self-analysis are dread dangers. But
the memories of school in after life are not in
the first instance memories of friends, but of
the places where those friends were met and the
friendships made. A boy's life is made up of
moments and impressions, and many of the
indelible impressions of his youth are formed
in the School Chapel. Hence the gift of a
beautiful School Chapel is the greatest gift a
man can give. Boys at Giggleswick have at
their right hand the natural glories of the
Craven District, they have now also a supreme
example of the architect's skill and courage and
success. Environment is the keynote to the
development of character. These boys have the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_203" id="Page_203">[Pg 203]</a></span>
twofold opportunity of profiting from Nature
and from Art.</p>

<p>The mind must go back three centuries
in the history of the School to find a parallel
to this gift, and even then no individual
example will stand comparison. The difficulties
of the work were great, but were surmounted
with complete success. The Chapel is a striking
and beautiful landmark. The Building was
begun in 1897, and the foundation stone was
laid with some ceremony on October 7, by the
Duke of Devonshire, and work proceeded for
four years without interruption.</p>

<p>There are many interesting features about
the building, and no expense was spared to get
the very best material. In the interior all the
fittings and seats were made of cedar wood
imported direct from Tucuman, a Province in
the Argentine. Two Bronze Statues, one of
Queen Victoria and one of Edward VI were
designed by Mr. George Frampton, A.R.A., and
placed in niches over the west door. A cast of
the one of Edward VI was given by the sculptor
and placed in Big School. The main feature
of the interior is one broad aisle in the centre,
balanced on either side by two passage aisles,
and the centre of the broad aisle is paved with
black and white marble. At the West end are
eight stalls with carved and pierced standards
to the canopies.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_204" id="Page_204">[Pg 204]</a></span></p>

<p>The Organ was the last instrument built
under the direction of Mr. Henry Willis&mdash;Father
Willis&mdash;and its construction was superintended
by Sir Walter Parratt. The outside
pipes are made of spotted metal, and the organ
has three manuals. The Pulpit was put in
later standing at the North-West end of the
Choir it is visible to the whole congregation.</p>

<p>The Dome was constructed in a way,
hitherto probably untried in Europe, it was
built without centering, on a principle of
interlocking blocks of terra cotta. The outside
is of timber covered with copper; inside on the
lower part with a gold background are mosaics
of sixteen angels. They are slightly over six
feet high, and are represented as playing musical
instruments; their wings cross one another
and give a fine pattern of colour. In the
pendentives are seated figures of the four
Evangelists. These were all worked, not from
the back as is usual, but from the face, and
each was fixed on the vault bit by bit.</p>

<p>The glass has special interest. The East

Lord, and the South Transept Window contains
figures of James Carr, Edward VI, Josias Shute,
Archdeacon Paley, the Headmaster and Mr.
Morrison. The Clerestory Windows contain in
groups of threes, Christian worthies of various
times.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_205" id="Page_205">[Pg 205]</a></span></p>

<p>The West Window was designed by the
Architect, and is a very curious representation
of the Creation, full of daring colour. The
roof and part of the walls are decorated with
sgraffito work. The Chapel was opened for use
on October 4, 1901, by Dr. Warre, Headmaster
of Eton, and dedicated by the Bishop of Ripon,
and has since been regularly used for services
on Sunday.</p>

<p>The generosity of Mr. Morrison did not
stop with the Chapel, but at the same time he
constructed a fine stone Pavilion at the West end
of the Cricket Ground, and a Gate-house and
Porter's Lodge at the entrance from the public
road. The enthusiasm aroused by the sight of
this open-handed generosity was so great that
it was at once determined to open a fund
for a portrait of Mr. Morrison and hang in Big
School. The subscribers were nearly four<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_206" id="Page_206">[Pg 206]</a></span>
hundred in number, and many of the old masters
and boys were among them. Sir Hubert Von
Herkomer was commissioned to paint the portrait,
and on July 28, 1903, it was unveiled in the
presence of a large gathering of people. It
is a striking portrait, and well suggests the
kindliness, humour, and generosity that are the
distinguishing features of Mr. Morrison's character.</p>

<p>It was close upon thirty-five years since
Mr. Style had first taken over the charge of
the School. The year 1869 had been a most
unpromising one in the history of Giggleswick;
the future was difficult and doubtful. But
courage is one of the first essentials in a
Schoolmaster, and Mr. Style had a full share.
Every old School is steeped with tradition, but
much of it at Giggleswick was bad, and
Mr. Style did his best to eradicate and replace
it. The boy of that period was a rougher boy
than is common in public schools to-day, and
he needed sterner treatment. Mr. Style was an
awe-inspiring disciplinarian, but he was no
Busby or Keate in his use of the rod. The
temper of Schoolmasters had been rapidly
improving, and there are no instances of the
astonishingly unjust punishments that were
common in an earlier day. In the early part of
the century one of the masters had once thrashed
a boy, and the apparent injustice of the punish<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_207" id="Page_207">[Pg 207]</a></span>ment
had been so indelibly inscribed upon the
boy's mind that years afterwards he came back
to the School, not with the feelings of affection
common to most men when they revisit the
scene of their boyhood, but filled with a fierce
resentment against his former master, and
vowing that if he were alive he would thrash
him within an inch of his life. Mr. Style was
of a different mould; he set before himself the
ideal of absolute justice, and this fact was
recognized by the School. On one occasion
some boys had placed an elaborate "booby"
trap, consisting of two dictionaries on the top
of the door of the end "prep" room and awaited
the arrival of their victim. To their horror the
door opened and crash went the dictionaries on
the Headmaster's top-hat. There was a moment
of awful suspense, and he said, "I know that
was not meant for me."</p>

<p>With the building of the Hostel it was
necessary to build up afresh a complete
system of school life. As the numbers increased
he established a monitorial system, by which
many of the lesser breaches of discipline were
dealt with by the boys themselves. There was
great opposition to the innovation on the part
of the boys, and as a consequence the system
never worked so well as it should have done.
These head boys were called Praepostors, a
conscious echo of the two "Praepositors" of<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_208" id="Page_208">[Pg 208]</a></span>
the first Statutes of 1592. Fagging was
allowed but was not unduly practised. It
consisted chiefly of running messages or blacking
boots or boiling water. Perhaps the most
unpleasant duty of the new boy was the compulsion
that he was under to sing for the benefit
of his elders.</p>

<p>On the second Saturday of term the senior
boys in the Hostel were assembled in the
underground Baths and every new boy was put
upon a chair in their midst and made to sing.
The penalty for singing out of tune was a cup
of salt and water but it is doubtful whether the
penalty was often enforced; even so there is no
continuous tradition; it was irregular and
spasmodic. Another task for the new boy was
to climb the Scars a quarter of a mile from the
School and place a stone upon the cairn, called
"Schoolboys' Tower."</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 440px;">
<img src="images/image0208.jpg" width="440" height="684" alt="CHAPEL, EAST." title="" />
<span class="caption">CHAPEL, EAST.</span>
</div>

<p>The Praepostors had also the power of
punishment by giving "lines" or by thrashing
but the latter was subject to proper control.
Some years previously the monitorial system in
schools had been given a new lease of life by
Arnold at Rugby and it was in theory a
legalised increase of the natural power possessed
by the Sixth Form; but it was often found that
intellect and strength of character did not
always accompany each other. At Giggleswick
no position in the School gave a prescriptive<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_209" id="Page_209">[Pg 209]</a></span>
right to be a Praepostor. The choice lay solely
in the hands of the Headmaster and although
more frequently those chosen were members of
the Sixth Form, it was by no means necessary,
and the captain of the Football Fifteen was
almost always chosen among them.</p>

<p>In the early days the Athletics of the
School needed much encouragement. The
Schoolyard for generations had provided the
only opportunity for games; Football and Cricket
were in their infancy. In most matches against
teams, other than schools, Mr. Style took a
personal part. He was a keen wicket-keeper
and a good bat and did not cease to play cricket
till 1890.</p>

<p>There were other ways in which his personal
character greatly influenced the boys. He spent
a great part of each day, when not in School,
in the Governors' Room at the South end of
the Hostel and there he was always ready to
see those who wished to speak to him on any
subject. Many received special tuition from
him after Evening Prayers and one great secret
of the esteem with which the boys regarded
him was the personal interest that he took in
their life. There is the story of a boy who
was particularly anxious to enter the School as
a day-boy, but his attainments were insufficient
for his age and he knew no Latin. He came
himself to see Mr. Style and to press for<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_210" id="Page_210">[Pg 210]</a></span>
admittance and at last he was told that if he
could learn some Latin before the entrance
examination of the following term, his age
should not stand in his way. At the same time
Mr. Style advised him to come to him every
now and then and tell him how he was getting
on. After a while the boy came and said that
he had learned the Latin Grammar as far as
the dative of the relative. On being asked why
the dative of the relative had been his limit, he
explained that his teacher had not been able to
pronounce it and so he could go no further.
He was put through some questions and could
not answer them but if asked to decline any
word he would do it in this fashion: <i>Mensa</i>
<i>mensae</i> <i>mensam</i> <i>mensas</i> <i>mensae</i> <i>mensarum</i> <i>mensae</i>
<i>mensis</i> <i>mensa</i> <i>mensis</i> and so on all through the
Grammar until he came to the relative and at
the dative he failed. Mr. Style considering
that the memorising of the Latin Grammar in
such a way implied some quickness of mind
told him to leave the school that he was at and
come to him at certain times each day. His
time-table was however very full and he could
only give the boy half an hour a day at 6-0
a.m. and 7-0 p.m. This he did and he found
the boy extremely quick and intelligent. He
passed him into the School the next term and
seeing he had a distinct gift for Mathematics
encouraged him in every way. Eventually he<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_211" id="Page_211">[Pg 211]</a></span>
sent him up to S. John's College, Cambridge,
with a Mathematical Scholarship and hoped that
at last he had prepared a boy who would be
Senior Wrangler. Unfortunately his health broke
down and he came out seventh but some years
later in 1889 was made a Fellow of the College.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 426px;">
<img src="images/image0211.jpg" width="426" height="698" alt="CHAPEL, WEST." title="" />
<span class="caption">CHAPEL, WEST.</span>
</div>

<p>Mr. Style was an early riser. Every
morning at 6-30, without fail, he was in the
Governors' Room ready to talk over any
necessary matters. He took very full duty in
School, and made himself chiefly responsible for
the higher Mathematical work; and in addition
with some assistance from Mr. Mannock or Mr.
Bearcroft, he undertook most of the laborious
business work connected with the organization
of the Hostel and the School.</p>

<p>His Assistant Masters always look back to
their days at Giggleswick as some of the
happiest they have ever spent. Mr. Style
was naturally anxious to keep his staff with
him as long as possible, but he realized
that he could not expect to do this while the
Trustees felt themselves unable to guarantee
salaries sufficient to enable a man to marry. He
gladly and generously helped them to find
promotion. Many became Headmasters. Mr. J.
Conway Rees, who for years had been the most
painstaking and successful of men in making the
Fifteen a match-winning side, left to become
head of a school connected with the Mohammedan<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_212" id="Page_212">[Pg 212]</a></span>
College at Aligarh. Mr. Rhodes went to
Ardingly, and so on.</p>

<p>Every Sunday, in the early days, Mr. and
Mrs. Style would ask the whole Hostel and
later, as the numbers increased, the upper
forms to come into the Governors' Room and
there they would be regaled with sandwiches
and lemonade and a musical evening would be
held. Bubble and Squeak the boys called these
evenings and they were much appreciated.
Delicate boys would sometimes spend a week or
a few days living in the Headmaster's house,
and sometimes boys would be invited who were
suffering from colds or other slight illnesses,
and thus in the middle of a term they would
find a short reminder of home life. In innumerable
ways the boys were made to feel that the
Headmaster was no official pedagogue but a
man such as their own fathers, and they felt a
corresponding affection for him.</p>

<span class="caption">THE GATE HOUSE.</span>
</div>

<p>Ascension Day was a whole holiday and for
some years the Headmaster was in the habit of
taking the whole School, after a service, out for
a day on the hills. On one occasion they went
to the top of Graygreth (near Kirkby Lonsdale)
on a very hot day. In the evening four boys
were found to be missing. The Headmaster
taking two boys with him scoured the hills till
darkness drew on, but in vain. At last they
came to a wayside inn and made inquiries,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_213" id="Page_213">[Pg 213]</a></span>
at which a yokel remarked "You must be a
fine Master, if you can't look after your own
boys." As a matter of fact all four boys were
in safe quarters at Kirkby Lonsdale, after losing
their way in a thick mist. This was the last
occasion on which the Headmaster ventured to
take the whole School out. In future the boys
went in smaller bodies with their House Tutors.</p>

<p>What was the secret of his power and his
success? First undoubtedly was the keenness
of his eye. "I have been all over the world
and I have never come across a man with as
keen an eye as Mr. Style" said one of his
former pupils. He seemed to look quite
through a man and there was no thought of
evasion with him. Then there was his thoroughness.
He was so absolutely devoted to his duty
that his example was bound to affect those who
came near him. It was noticeable in everything
he did. He played a game of cricket as if it were
the most important thing in life. Thirdly he
had another most necessary quality in a Headmaster,
the power of choosing the right Assistant
Masters. Dr. Marshall Watts, G. B. Mannock,
Douglas R Smith, S. P. Smith, C. F. Hyde,
Rev. J. W. Chippett, A. W. Reith, are only a
few among the many who helped him with
every quality they possessed.</p>

<p>As a teacher he was sometimes unable to
restrain himself with a dull boy. "Do you<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_214" id="Page_214">[Pg 214]</a></span>
understand?" he asked a boy who was struggling
with the intricacies of Algebra. "No sir."
"My good man! My fine owl! Now do you
understand?" But with the abler boys he was
remarkably successful. In October, 1896, there
were twenty-six old boys at Oxford and
Cambridge and of these twelve were Scholars or
Exhibitioners of their College, two played for
the Cambridge Rugby Fifteen, one rowed against
Oxford, and another gained his half-blue for
Swimming. This year represented perhaps one
of the latest successful years. Between 1880
and 1894 nothing could go wrong; numbers
increased and Scholarships were gained but
about the latter year the School suffered a serious
set-back owing to an outbreak of scarlet fever
and the numbers began to sink.</p>

<p>During the long period of growth Mr. Style
was watchful over every detail of the building
that was going on, and was projecting much
for the future. "It is my opinion that the
Headmaster is never happy, unless he can hear
the sound of hammer and nails," an Old Boy
once said. He was determined that the School
should have the very best buildings and fittings
possible, although he was never at a loss to
carry things on when a makeshift was necessary.</p>

<p>"Some of the best Science work that has been
done here was done in my scullery," were
his words.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_215" id="Page_215">[Pg 215]</a></span></p>

<p>This absorbing love of the School was a
tonic to every one who was under him. He
came at a time when there was only a collection
of boys with no unity and no sound traditions.
He left it united and loyal. He came to a rich
endowment, which was spending its resources
with little visible result. He left the School
prosperous, and possessed of a reputation all
over England. He had been among the first
Headmasters to acknowledge the value of a
training in Natural Science, and he showed
men that a thorough and efficient training in
modern subjects could be given in one of the
oldest of England's Public Schools. He did
not wait upon time, he did not waver upon his
path, but marched straight forward.</p>

<p>Prosperity grew step by step, buildings rose
up, numbers increased, and distinctions were
won, but behind all the outward success was
the vitalising energy of the Headmaster, the
inspiration of the optimist, the personality of
the man.</p>

<h2>The Last Decade.</h2>


<p><span class="dropcap">I</span>N January, 1904, the Governors of the School
assembled to elect a new Headmaster.
Their choice fell unanimously on Mr.
William Wyamar Vaughan. Mr. Vaughan had
been educated at Rugby and New College,
Oxford, where he graduated in 1888. Since
1890 he had been an Assistant Master at
Clifton College, and had been in charge of
seventy day boys there for four years. The
appointment was in many respects a significant
one. For the first time in the
history of the School a permanent Headmaster
had been appointed, who was not in Holy
Orders. Since 1869 the statutory regulation
on the subject had been changed, but this was
the first occasion on which the Governors had
exercised their freedom. In the second place,
Giggleswick up till the last thirty years had
educated a preponderating number of day boys,
but lately this element had been so outnumbered
by the boarders that there was considerable
danger of a serious division arising between
them. The election of a man who had been in
charge of the day boys at one of the bigger
Public Schools gave great hopes to those who<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_217" id="Page_217">[Pg 217]</a></span>
had the unity of the School at heart, nor were
these expectations unfulfilled. Thirdly, Mr.
Vaughan was a pioneer in the enthusiasm which
directed the path of learning towards a greater
study of English subjects.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 479px;">

</div>

<p>The chief responsibility of the military
side at Clifton had lain with him of late
years, and at Giggleswick he lost little time in
reorganizing the classification of the School. A
scheme was carried through by which every boy
was classed according to his attainments in
English, and one hour a day was given to the
study of the subject in its various branches
of Scripture, History, Geography, Literature,
and occasionally Grammar. The weekly theme
or essay was retained. For all other subjects
the boy was put into sets, which bore no relation
to his Form, except in so far as the School was
divided up for English into three parts&mdash;Upper,
Lower and Junior, and for other subjects into
A, B and C, Blocks. No boy was able to be in
the B Block who was in the Junior School, or
in the A Block, if he was in the Lower School.
These big divisions were very rarely found to
hinder the advance of a boy in any particular
subject and when once he had obtained a
position in the Upper School, want of capacity
in English was of no impediment at all. The great
ideal at which Mr. Vaughan aimed was a sound
education in a varied number of subjects but<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_218" id="Page_218">[Pg 218]</a></span>
all of them must be based on the study of
English. Boys were not encouraged to specialize
until they had attained to a position in one of the
two top Forms and in later years not until they
had gained the Oxford and Cambridge Higher
Certificate. The School was inspected by the
Oxford and Cambridge Board in 1906 and the
reports were most gratifying. In the same year
the Higher Certificate Examination was taken
by the Sixth and Upper Fifth, and in future
became a regular feature of their work.</p>

<p>The School suffered a severe loss in 1904
by the resignation of Dr. Watts. He had acted
as the chief Master of Natural Science for thirty-two
years and had superintended the building
of the Science Block from its foundations. Mr.
C. F. Mott a former Scholar of Trinity College,
Cambridge, and a Lecturer at Emmanuel College
was appointed to succeed him and no choice could
have been more happy. A Scientific Society
was soon formed with the object of giving a
lead to the informal study of Nature and to
promote a closer interest in the collections of
various kinds at the School Museum. In the
following year 1905 Speech-Day was celebrated
for the first time for twenty-five years and was
marked by the presentation of the "Style"
Mathematical Prizes, which had been founded
from a fund to which former pupils of Mr. Style
contributed as a mark of their appreciation of<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_219" id="Page_219">[Pg 219]</a></span>
his Headmastership. In 1906 the "Waugh"
Prizes for English Literature were presented by
Mr. John Waugh, J.P., who had been at the
School under Dr. Butterton and had retained a
strong interest in education. These prizes were
to be awarded on the result of two papers, one
on a specially prepared subject in English
Literature and one on a general knowledge of
the whole.</p>

<span class="caption">ATHLETIC SHOP.</span>
</div>

<p>Many smaller changes were made in the
School-life in the next few years. The four
dormitories which had hitherto been known by
letters A, B, C, D, were re-named in 1907 after
four benefactors of the School&mdash;Paley, Nowell,
Carr, and Shute, thus recalling to mind something
of the traditions to which the boys were
heirs. The Gate-house, which had been built
by Mr. Morrison at the time of the building
of the Chapel was further utilized as a Shop,
where boys from the Hostel could at certain
hours buy most kinds of food. Previously they
had been able to buy what they required from
a shop in the village but this had always been
open to disadvantages and the opening of the
Gate-house in 1906 under Mr. and Mrs. Parker,
who had both been connected with the School
for many years, obviated these disadvantages;
it also secured a useful profit, which could be
laid out by the School in what way they wished.</p>

<p>But one of the most important events of Mr.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_220" id="Page_220">[Pg 220]</a></span>
Vaughan's Headmastership was the foundation
in 1906 of the Giggleswick Boys' Club in Leeds.
The great danger of Public School life is the
difficulty of realizing that the unit of the School
is a part of a larger whole and that one aim of
education is the inculcation of an active interest
in all spheres of life. The aim of the founders
of the Giggleswick Boys' Club was to provide
a house in one of the poorer districts, where
boys might spend certain evenings in the week
in warmth and comfort. An excellent man was
fortunately found in Sergeant-Major Baker, who
was willing to take the whole responsibility of
the internal management. The Club was begun
at 2, West Street, Leeds, and at the end of a
year the average attendance was found to have
been thirty. Every Summer as many boys as
possible come down to Giggleswick for a day, and
a cricket match is arranged. There is a very noteworthy
feeling of affection for the School springing
up in the Club and its general success is assured.</p>

<p>Another departure from ordinary school
routine was made in the same year. A Rifle
Club was formed for the purpose of teaching
boys to shoot. Mr. J. G. Robinson, a Governor
of the School, presented a Sub-Target Rifle
Machine, which was placed in the Covered
Playground and under the direction of Sergeant-Major
Cansdale a considerable number of the
School practised shooting.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_221" id="Page_221">[Pg 221]</a></span></p>

<span class="caption">G. B. MANNOCK.</span>
</div>

<p>The year 1907 was a very important one
in the history of the School. On November 12,
just four hundred years before, the lease of the
plot of ground, on which James Carr built his
first School, had been signed. The occasion
was one which was fittingly celebrated. A
Thanksgiving Service was held in the Chapel
and Mr. Style, the late Headmaster, attended it
and was gladly welcomed. Mr. J. G. Robinson,
took the opportunity of presenting the School
with two new covered-in Fives Courts at the
back of Brookside, and, closely adjoining it,
he built and fitted up a metal workshop, where
boys could indulge their taste for engineering.</p>

<p>In the same year another inspection of the
School was invited by the Headmaster and the
Board of Education sent down three examiners.
The result was most encouraging for they had
come down somewhat prejudiced about the
usefulness of the education received there but
they went away convinced that Giggleswick was
performing its duty in a way that merited the
highest commendation. The Carr Exhibitions
at Christ's College, Cambridge, which were
reserved for Giggleswick boys, were still given
but, owing to the decrease in the value of land,
were at this time limited to one in every three
years. They nevertheless proved a most useful
means of helping those boys, who were unable
to go up to the University without aid.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_222" id="Page_222">[Pg 222]</a></span></p>

<p>A year later, on May 26, 1908, Mr. G. B.
Mannock died suddenly. Since 1874 he had been
a Master at the School. He had taught the First
Form during the whole of the time and had
also in earlier days taken over the charge of the
Drawing and Music. In 1887 when it was
decided to lease Bankwell as a house for those
boys who were too young to go immediately
into the Hostel, Mr. Mannock, who had been
previously a Dormitory Master for the younger
boys in the Hostel, was asked to undertake the
responsibility of being the Master-in-charge.
He continued to do so till his death. The
influence that he had exerted was a very remarkable
one. No boy ever came away from Bankwell
without feeling that for some time in his life at
any rate he had lived under the protection of one
of the most saintly of men. Friendship and
sympathy were the very essence of his character
and he taught every one with whom he came
in touch, that gentleness and courtesy were
weapons, stronger and more valuable than any
others. A fund was raised to perpetuate his
memory and it was decided to decorate the
Class Rooms with panelling and hang them
with pictures. In the Sixth Form Room
Honour Boards were also erected. It was felt
that this improvement in the decoration of the
School would be a fitting tribute to one, whose
joy in beauty was so deep and sure.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_223" id="Page_223">[Pg 223]</a></span></p>

<p>The close of Mr. Vaughan's time at Giggleswick
was marked by two schemes of the utmost
importance. A contingent of the Officers
Training Corps was established under the
direction of the Rev. C. F. Pierce. Mr. Pierce
had enjoyed no previous experience of military
training, but he threw himself into the work
with enthusiasm. The Summer Term in 1910
saw its beginning, and within a year there had
been a consistent average of between fifty-five
and sixty boys in the Corps. They have two
field-days a term, and go to the Public Schools'
Camp at Aldershot or Salisbury each August.
In 1911 the Corps went to Windsor to be
reviewed by the King, and were members of a
Brigade which was widely noted in the newspapers
for its appearance and marching.</p>

<span class="caption">OFFICERS&#39; TRAINING CORPS.</span>
</div>

<p>The second scheme that was undertaken
at this time was the improvement of the Cricket
Ground. The ground rested on a foundation
of peat, which acted like a sponge, and it
was almost impossible in an average summer to
get a fast wicket. It was proposed that a
sum of six or seven hundred pounds should
be collected, and some means should be
found of draining the ground thoroughly. Mr.
Edwin Gould, one of the Assistant Masters, was
chiefly instrumental in gaining acceptance for
the scheme, and his appeal for funds was
responded to well. The work was begun in the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_224" id="Page_224">[Pg 224]</a></span>
Autumn of 1910, and it was hoped that it would
be finished before the Summer of 1911, but
this was found impossible. The underlying
foundation of peat was so deep that all hope
of digging it up was abandoned. It was instead
decided to heighten the general level of the
ground by six feet, and to do so by filling in
with earth and stone. The work was very
laborious owing to the blasting operations that
had to be carried out, but the ground has been
enlarged in every direction, and in course of
time should prove one of the best in England.
While the work was in progress Cricket was
played during the Summer of 1911 on the
Football Field, and a remarkably fast wicket
was obtained.</p>

<p>During Mr. Vaughan's time the Athletics
of the School had not been maintained at the
same high pitch as in previous years. The
great success of the ninety's had not continued.
It is difficult for a school to be successful both
in work and games, and in the early years of the
century the School was not so large in numbers
as it had been in the best years of Mr. Style;
the choice of players was therefore more limited.
Nevertheless, throughout the School there was a
general tendency to take up more than one
branch of sport. Golf, Fives, Gymnastics, all
received gifts of Challenge Cups, and considerable
competition resulted. In 1908 Captain Thompson,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_225" id="Page_225">[Pg 225]</a></span>
of Beck House, generously presented a Cup for
a Cross Country Race. The Scar-Rigg Race,
as it has been called, is three miles long, and
starting near the top of the Scar Quarry, the
competitors run along its top till they get to
the summit of Buckhaw Brow, after which they
run across the fields, over the High Rigg Road
and down to the finish near the Chapel. It is
a fine course and, though a hard one, does not
try the strength of the runners unduly.</p>

<p>In April, 1910, the Headmaster received an
unanimous invitation from the Governors of
Wellington College to be the Master there. It
was a great grief to Giggleswick that she should
lose one, who, though she had known him only
for six years, had even in that brief period
stamped himself upon the imagination of
them all.</p>

<p>During his Headmastership everyone
connected with the School seemed to gain a
closer and more personal interest in its fortunes.
He treated men as if they were themselves
possessed of more than usual individuality. No
one was expected to be a mere automaton, useful
but replaceable. There was a special part
of the School organization which each man was
made to feel was precisely the part that he
could play. Dormitory Masters were given
greater independence, boys, especially the older
boys, were made to realize that they also had<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_226" id="Page_226">[Pg 226]</a></span>
a deep responsibility in the welfare of the School.
The great features in Mr. Vaughan's character
were his insight into the best qualities of all who
surrounded him and the generous optimism of
his judgment. It was a difficult task for any
man to succeed to the work of Mr. Style, who
had built up the School afresh through many
arduous difficulties, but Mr. Vaughan realized
that the passing of the period of rapid enlargement
laid upon him the responsibility of
fostering the slow and unostentatious work of
profiting by the past and of seeing that the
reputation of the School was maintained and
increased. He was essentially an idealist, a
dreamer of dreams, a visionary, but he never
lost sight of the practicable. Organization was
his handmaid.</p>

<p>Parents, Masters and Boys were quick to
recognize the sincerity of the man. He was
often impetuous but he was always candid.
His decisions were firm, but he never shirked
an argument. His sermons in Chapel were
not steeped in oratory but the directness of his
appeal, the persistent summons to the standard
of Duty and the obvious depth of his emotion
gave them power. Largeness of numbers never
appealed to him, and he did not in any way
strive to call the attention of the world to the
School. He wished for success in Scholarships
and in Athletics but he regarded the School as<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_227" id="Page_227">[Pg 227]</a></span>
he regarded the individual. Distinction in work
or games was no passport to his favour, but he
continually looked only for the right use of
such capacity as each one possessed. Frequently
he would take boys from the lower part of the
School and himself give them private tuition.
Character was more than intellect. The boys
learned to know him as their friend and he
would go into their studies in the evening and
be gladly welcomed. The unity of the School
was much increased, the Hostel had no special
privileges and at the close of his Headmastership
the six years had witnessed a steady growth in
the effectiveness of the School. No one ever
forgot that he was Headmaster but at the same
time he never failed to encourage others to act
for themselves. He had a single-minded desire
for the good of the School and he inspired
others with it. His contempt for outworn
conventions, his sincerity, his generosity of heart,
even his impetuous nature impressed all alike
with the feeling that they were dealing with
one, who was essentially a man.</p>

<p>A successor to Mr. Vaughan was soon found
in Mr. Robert Noel Douglas, who after
having had a distinguished Academic and
Athletic career at Selwyn College, Cambridge,
had been appointed Assistant Master
at Uppingham in 1892. There he had
acted as a House Master for some years<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_228" id="Page_228">[Pg 228]</a></span>
previously to his appointment to Giggleswick.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 488px;">
<img src="images/image0228.jpg" width="488" height="682" alt="R. N. DOUGLAS, M.A." title="" />
<span class="caption">R. N. DOUGLAS, M.A.</span>
</div>

<p>Soon after the new Headmaster had been
appointed, Mr. Philip Bearcroft retired from his
work as Bursar. Since 1878 he had been a
Master at the School and had acted as Form
Master, Dormitory Master and later as Bursar.
The older generation of Giggleswick boys look
back with peculiar affection to the days when
they were in his form&mdash;The Transitus&mdash;as it
was then called. They remember his enthusiasm
and his loyalty and his conscientious devotion to
the School. Many had hoped that his retirement
from active work would prelude some years of
life released from anxiety, but death has claimed
him with the hope unfulfilled. In May, 1912,
he made his last visit to the School and two
days later he died.</p>

<p>During the two years since 1910 the
progress of the School has been very steady.
Almost every term has seen the numbers
increase, until they are at the present time just
under one hundred-and-fifty. The Officers
Training Corps has flourished, an Athletic shop
has been opened, and in every respect the
development of the School has continued. A
great loss however was suffered when Sergeant-Major
Cansdale retired in April, 1912, after
completing twenty-five years of work. He had
originally come to Giggleswick in 1887 as an
Instructor in the Gymnasium, but when Mr.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_229" id="Page_229">[Pg 229]</a></span>
Vaughan instituted the practice of Swedish Drill,
Sergeant-Major Cansdale gladly seconded the
change, and the improvement in the general
physique of the School bears tribute to his
skill. The year 1912 also marks the four
hundredth anniversary of the opening of the
First School, which had been built under the
guidance of the Founder, James Carr. The
importance of the anniversary is being celebrated
by the raising of a fund, from which entrance
scholarships of good monetary value may be
established, and so a sound educational step
forward will have been taken, and one true to
the best traditions of the School. The four
centuries that have passed by have witnessed
many changes in the world of education. New
ideals have prevailed and have altered the bases
of the past. But Giggleswick may look back
upon its history with a consciousness that it
has seldom failed to do its duty. It shall not
fail to-day.</p>

advantage or emolument in the School or out of the endowment of the
Foundation to which he would otherwise have been entitled.</p>

<p>(<i>b</i>) If the parent or guardian of, or person liable to maintain or
having the actual custody of, any boy who is about to attend the School
and who but for this sub-clause could only be admitted as a boarder,
desires the exemption of such boy from attending prayer or religious
worship, or from any lesson or series of lessons on a religious subject,
but the persons in charge of the boarding-houses of the School are not
willing to allow such exemption, then it shall be the duty of the
Governors to make proper provisions for enabling the boy to attend the
School and have such exemption as a day pupil, without being deprived
of any advantage or emolument to which he would otherwise have been
entitled.</p>

<p>(<i>c</i>) If any teacher, in the course of other lessons, at which any boy
exempted under this clause is in accordance with the ordinary rules of
the School present, teaches systematically and persistently any
particular religious doctrine from the teaching of which any exemption
has been claimed as in this clause before provided, the Governors shall,
on complaint made in writing to them by the parent, guardian, or
person liable to maintain or having the actual custody of such boy,
hear the complainant, and inquire into the circumstances, and if the
complaint is judged to be reasonable, make all proper provisions for
remedying the matter complained of.</p>

<p class="center"><i>Examinations.</i></p>

<p>38. Once at least in every two years there shall be, at the cost of
the Foundation, an examination of the whole of each of the upper
forms of the School by, or under the direction of, a University or other
examining body approved by the Board of Education, with the
assistance, if the Governors think fit, of any of the teaching staff of the
School; and a report thereon shall be made to the Governors, who shall
send copies of it to the Head Master and to the West Riding County
Council and two copies to the Board of Education. Provided that the
Board may, either generally or in any particular year, dispense with
that examination as regards any of the upper forms.</p>

<p>Once at least in every year there shall be an examination of the
lower forms by the teaching staff of the School, and a report thereon
shall be made to the Governors if they require it.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_272" id="Page_272">[Pg 272]</a></span></p>

<p>An examination may be partly in writing and partly oral, or, in the
lower forms, wholly oral. If in any year the School as a whole is
inspected by the Board of Education, the Board may dispense with
any examination for that and the following year. The Board may
decide which forms shall be considered to be "upper" and "lower"
respectively for the purposes of this clause.</p>

<p class="center"><span class="smcap">Conditions of Admission.</span></p>

<p class="center"><i>Ages for School.</i></p>

<p>40. Subject as herein provided, no boy shall be admitted to the
School under the age of 9 years. No boy shall remain in the School
after the end of the school year, in which the age of 19 is attained.
The Head Master shall make rules for the withdrawal of boys from the
School in cases where, from idleness, or incapacity to profit by the
studies of the place, they have fallen materially below the standard of
position and attainment proper for their age.</p>

<p class="center"><i>Application for Admission.</i></p>

<p>41. Applications for admission to the School shall be made to the

<p class="center"><i>Register of Applications.</i></p>

<p>42. The Head Master or some person appointed by the Governors

the date of their application.</p>

<p class="center"><i>Fees.</i></p>

<p>44. No fee, payment, or gratuity shall be received from or on
behalf of any boy in the School, except in accordance with Rules for

<p class="center"><i>Exemptions from Fees.</i></p>

<p>45. (1.) The Rules for Payments shall provide for total or partial
exemptions from payment of tuition fees or entrance fees.</p>

<p>(2.) They shall, among other things, provide&mdash;</p>

<p class="hangindent">(<i>a</i>) that a yearly sum of not less than 60<i>l.</i> out of the income of
the Foundation applicable for the general purposes of
the School may, if funds permit, be applied in providing
total or partial exemptions from payment of tuition fees
for boys who are and have for not less than three years

<p class="hangindent">(<i>b</i>) that the income of the property representing the endowment
of Josias Shute shall be applied in providing total
exemptions from payment of tuition fees and the cost of
books and stationery, to be called Shute Scholarships,
and to be offered in the first instance to boys who are and
have for not less than two years been in attendance at a
Public Elementary School in the Ancient Parish of
Giggleswick;<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_274" id="Page_274">[Pg 274]</a></span></p>

<p>and may also provide&mdash;</p>

<p class="hangindent">(<i>c</i>) that any boys who are exempted from payment of tuition
fees under the provisions of sub-clauses (2) (<i>a</i>) and (2) (<i>b</i>)
of this clause, and who by reason of their proficiency are
deserving of the distinction, shall be called Giggleswick
Scholars and Shute Scholars respectively, and that any
other boys who are exempted from payment of tuition
fees, and are likewise worthy of the distinction, shall be
called Foundation Scholars.</p>

<p class="center"><i>Maintenance Allowances.</i></p>

<p>46. The Governors may award to such of the Giggleswick
Scholars or Foundation Scholars as in the opinion of the Governors
are in need of financial assistance to enable them to enter or remain in
the School, Maintenance Allowances each of a yearly value of not more
than 5<i>l.</i> Any such Allowance may, at the discretion of the Governors,
be paid to the parent or guardian of the boy, or may be applied by
them towards payments (other than tuition or entrance fees under the
Rules for Payments or in providing the boy with travelling facilities
or meals).</p>

<p class="center"><i>Boys' Moiety of Yearly Sum of 90l.</i></p>

<p>47. The Governors shall apply one moiety of the above-mentioned
yearly sum of 90<i>l.</i>, in one or both of the following ways:&mdash;</p>

<p class="hangindent">(1) in providing additional Shute Scholarships,</p>

<p class="hangindent">(2) in awarding maintenance allowances each of a yearly value of
not more than 10<i>l.</i> to Shute Scholars.</p>

<p>Any unapplied residue of the said moiety shall be applied by the
Governors in augmenting the value of the Giggleswick and other
Exhibitions herein-after mentioned.</p>

<p class="center"><i>Boarding Scholarships.</i></p>

<p>48. The Governors may, if funds permit, apply a yearly sum of
not more than 150<i>l.</i> out of the income of the Foundation applicable for
the purposes of the School in the maintenance of Boarding Scholarships,
each consisting of exemption, total or partial, from payment of
boarding fees. These Scholarships may be held in conjunction with
any Scholarship or Exemption maintained under this Scheme.</p>

<p class="center"><i>Giggleswick and other Leaving Exhibitions.</i></p>

<p>49. The Governors shall, as soon as funds permit, maintain a
Leaving Exhibition, to be called the Giggleswick Exhibition, of the
yearly value of not less than 30<i>l.</i> nor more than 50<i>l.</i> to be awarded for
proficiency in any one or more of the subjects of general instruction<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_275" id="Page_275">[Pg 275]</a></span>
provided for by this Scheme. They may also maintain (1) a Leaving
Exhibition to be called the Clapham and Tennant Exhibition, and
(2) other Leaving Exhibitions.</p>

<p class="hangindent">(<i>a</i>) The Exhibitions shall be tenable at any University, Training
College for pupils intending to enter the teaching profession,
or other Institution of higher, including professional or
technical, instruction.</p>

<p class="hangindent">(<i>b</i>) An Exhibition shall be either</p>

<p class="hangindent" style="padding-left:6em;">(i) a single payment, or</p>

<p class="hangindent" style="padding-left:6em;">(ii) a series of payments extending over not more than four
years,</p>

<p>and in either case shall not exceed a total value of 200<i>l.</i></p>

<p class="hangindent">(<i>c</i>) Exhibitions shall be awarded for merit only, on the result of
such examination as the Governors think fit, to boys who
then are and have for not less than two years been in the
School. Within the limits fixed by this Scheme the Exhibitions
shall be freely and openly competed for, and shall be
awarded under such rules and conditions as the Governors
think fit, but so that as nearly as possible the same number
may be awarded each year. Any Exhibition for which there
is no duly qualified candidate, who on examination is adjudged
worthy to take it, shall for that turn not be awarded.</p>

<p class="center"><i>Deprivation.</i></p>

<p>50. The Scholarships and Exhibitions shall be tenable only for
the purposes of education. If, in the judgment of the Governors, the
holder of any Scholarship or Exhibition or any boy exempted as
aforesaid is guilty of serious misconduct or idleness, or fails to
maintain a reasonable standard of proficiency, or ceases to pursue his
education, the Governors may deprive him of the Scholarship,
Exhibition, Exemption, or any Maintenance Allowance, but in the case
of an Exemption (unless the Rules for Payments otherwise provide)
only upon grounds sufficient to justify the removal of any boy from
the School. In the case of an Exhibition, the Governors may act on
the report of the proper authorities of the University, College, or
Institution, at which the Exhibition is held, or on such other evidence
as the Governors think sufficient. Under this clause the decision of
the Governors shall be final in each case.</p>

<p class="center"><span class="smcap">Special Departments.</span></p>

<p class="center"><i>Preparatory Department.</i></p>

<p>51. The Governors may, if they think fit, maintain in the School<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_276" id="Page_276">[Pg 276]</a></span>
a Preparatory Department for the education of boys. For this department
the Governors may make such modifications as they think fit in
the foregoing provisions relating to ages, instruction, and examination,
and the Rules for payments may prescribe such tuition fees as may be
thought suitable.</p>

<p class="center"><i>Education of intending Elementary School Teachers.</i></p>

<p>52. The Governors may, with the approval in writing of the
Board of Education, make special provision in or in connexion with
the School for the education of boys who intend to qualify as teachers
in Public Elementary Schools. For these boys, subject to the like
approval, the Governors may make such modifications as they think
fit in the foregoing provisions relating to ages, instruction, and
examination, and the Rules for Payments may prescribe such tuition
fees as may be thought suitable.</p>

<p class="center"><span class="smcap">Settle Girls' School.</span></p>

<p class="center"><i>Payment to Settle Girls' School.</i></p>

<p>53. The Governors shall pay the other moiety of the said yearly
sum of 90<i>l.</i> to the Governing Body of the new Public Secondary
School for girls established or about to be established at Settle, to be
applied by such Governing Body for the general purposes of that
School, on condition that the Governing Body maintain therein not less
than three free places for girls who are resident in the Ancient Parish
of Giggleswick, and who are and have for not less than two years been
in attendance at a Public Elementary School.</p>

<p>55. The first meeting of the Governors shall be summoned by the

office of Head Master of the School under this Scheme. He shall be<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_277" id="Page_277">[Pg 277]</a></span>
entitled while holding office to receive a fixed yearly stipend of 200<i>l.</i>
and also a capitation payment calculated on such a scale, uniform or
graduated, as may be fixed from time to time by the Governors, at the
rate of not less than 4<i>l.</i> a year for each boy in the School.</p>

<p class="center"><i>Saving of Interests.</i></p>

<p>57. No boy who is and on 8 September 1909 was in the School
shall be liable to any payment to which he might not have been liable
if this Scheme had not been made, and any holder of a Scholarship
or Exhibition awarded on or before the date of this Scheme shall be
entitled to hold his Scholarship or Exhibition as if this Scheme had
not been made.</p>

William Inchbold, painter and poet."&mdash;<i>Spectator.</i></p>

<p>"Mr. Draper has done his work well."&mdash;<i>The
Times.</i></p>

<p>"In 'Adel and its Norman Church' the
present Rector has enlarged a familiar
picture and placed it in a worthier frame....
Adel and its Church are the embodiment of
our National History for seven centuries, and
Mr. Draper's book is of much more than local
topographical value.... That little Norman
temple the religious home of English country
folk, so serene, so undisturbed by change, is a
symbol of abiding verities which should be
cooling now and then to dwell upon....
Apart from this the volume is valuable for
its illustrations, which contain several not
